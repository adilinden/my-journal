summary: I have already written about the ATmega32U4 based *uino-32u4 I've created. Today I received the circuit board order. The order was placed with Seeed Studio's Fusion PCB Service on December 24, 2011 and arrived at my door on January 13, 2012. I am impressed, at the speedy service and the quality of the boards. So far this has been an all round awesome exerperience!

I have already written about the ATmega32U4 based [*uino-32u4](uino-32u4-born) I've created. Today I received the circuit board order. The order was placed with [Seeed Studio's][] [Fusion PCB Service][] on December 24, 2011 and arrived at my door on January 13, 2012. I am impressed, at the speedy service and the quality of the boards. So far this has been an all round awesome exerperience!

Unfortunately I do not have any ATmega32U4-AU on hand. Soldering things to the board, getting it fired up and programming it will have to wait a little while longer. But I am excited and happy for this to have become a real physical thing, not just a figment of my imagination.

And just in case anyone wonders, I should have used a better camera to take these pictures. There are some significant distortions present caused by the camera. The boards are true and square.
