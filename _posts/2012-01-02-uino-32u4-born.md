![*uino-32u4](/resources/2012-01-02-uino-32u4-born/uino-32u4-brd-150x117.png)

I have been thinking about some electronics projects again. While looking at processors and other details I discovered [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) and also the Arduino compatible [chipKit UNO32](http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,892,893&Prod=CHIPKIT-UNO32). These are some pretty neat devices which come with a development platform that runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

Instead of buying an original Arduino I bought some shields for projects and set out to build my own Arduino platform. Hence the *uino-32u4 was born. It is based on the soon to be release Arduino Leonardo. The Arduino folks were kind enough to include support for Leonardo in Arduino 1.0. So my *uino-32u4 should be supported out of the box.

The files for *uino-32u4 are available on [Github](https://github.com/adilinden/uino-32u4). The project has been released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License, CC BY-SA.
