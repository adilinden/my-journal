**_Ingredients_**

**Light Dough**

* 300g Soft Butter
* 275g Sugar
* 1 Pkg Vanilla Sugar
* 5 Eggs
* 1 Dash of Salt
* 500g Flour
* 5 Teaspoons Baking Powder
* 125ml Warm Milk

**Dark Dough**

* 30g Cocoa
* 25g Sugar
* 3 Tablespoons Milk

**Preparation**

**1.** Place butter and sugar in a mixing bowl. Using a mixer, beat on low until smooth. Slowly add vanilla sugar, eggs and salt to the mixture while stirring. Mix flour and baking powder, slowly add flour and milk to the batter alternately, while stirring. Only add enough milk to obtain a thick batter.

**2.** Grease and flour a bundt cake pan and fill with 2/3 of the dough.

**3.** Add cocoa, sugar and milk to remaining 1/3 batter and mix in well. Add the dark batter to the light batter in the cake pan. Use a fork in a swirling motion to mix the dark batter into the light batter.

**4.** Bake the cake at 365°F (185°C) for 65 minutes. Test cake with a wooden toothpick until it comes out clean.

**5.** Let the cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Remove from pan and garnish with icing sugar or a glaze.
