**Cake**

* 3 Teaspoons Dry Yeast
* 50g Sugar
* 375g Flour
* 1 Egg
* 1 Dash of Salt
* 2 Tablespoons Lemon Juice
* 1/2 Teaspoon Cinnamon
* 150ml Warm Milk
* 60g Warm Butter
* 4lb Prune Plums

**Streusel Toppping**

* 200g Flour (for Streusels)
* 150g Sugar (for Streusels)
* 150g Butter (for Streusels)

**Preparation**

**1.** Fill a cup half full with some of the milk and some of the sugar. Stir the yeast into the mixture. Let stand until yeast foams and fills cup. Place flour in a large bowl and make 2 indentations in the flour. Place remaining sugar, flour, egg, salt, lemon juice, remaining milk and butter in one indentation and the yeast mixture in the other. Work all ingredients into a smooth dough. Let dough rise for about 15 minutes. Work dough again thoroughly and let rise for another 15 minutes.

**2.** For streusel topping place flour, sugar and butter in a bowl. Quickly work with your hands until large crumbles form. Keep cool if not immediately used.

**3.** Wash the prune plums, slice them open from the top around one side and the bottom, leaving one side still attached, remove pit, then slice each half again but not all the way through. Prune should still be attached with 4 sections.

**4.** Roll out dough to fit a large cookie sheet (about 35 x 40cm). Spread the prune plums on the dough, overlapping them generously. Distrubute streusels evenly over the prunes. Let rise again for 15 minutes. Bake in preheated oven at 390Â°F (200Â°C) for 25 - 30 Minutes.

**5.** Serve with whipped cream.
