title: Reflections of a Wandering Mind
---

... captures the gist of me.

I am a networking, VMware, Linux professional.  I enjoy electronic design, amateur radio and programming in various programming languages.  I am an enthusiastic photographer.  I love to bake and some times cook for fun.  I have built a home and extensively renovated another.  All while raising three children with my wonderful wife.

[K-Net](http://knet.ca) is my employer, where I lead a team that builds and maintains a large communications network spanning Nortwestern Ontario, Northern Manitoba and Northern Quebec.

On these pages I share some of the things that I do, whether it be hobby or professional.  I wish there was more, but updating web pages seems to take on a rather low priority in my life.  Regardless, I do hope that you will find something of use here ...
