(even "Hey - you've got a typo at..." messages)

<p align="left">In this article I'm attempting to help identify 
the model and chassis numbers of Mitreks that are good for both 
repeaters and for links. &nbsp; I've deliberately left out the 
800mhz and 900mhz radios since I have no manuals or hands-on experience 
with them.</p>

<p align="left">There is additional Mitrek information available 
on the Repeater-Builder web site at 
<a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/rbtip/mitrek-index.html">the main Mitrek index page</a>.</p>

<p>This web page is intended to be use by folks that have some familiarity 
with Moto model numbers. &nbsp; All of the Motorola model numbers from the 
Mitrek and earlier vintages are in a standard predictable format that tells 
the frequency band, power level and options of the radio. &nbsp; Please see the 
general <a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/motorola-suffixes.html">"Figuring out what you 
have"</a> page at <a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/motorola-suffixes.html">http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/motorola-suffixes.html</a> for the basic info. &nbsp; I 
am going to assume that you are familiar with that web page as I continue 
here - all that is on <u>this</u> page is Mitrek-specific information.</p>

<p align="left">The Motorola Mitrek series radios are very 
desirable for building repeaters and link radios despite the 
fact that the early versions are almost 20 years old...</p>

<p>As far as using a Mitrek in amateur repeat or link service, remember that the Mitrek mobile transmitter was not designed to be a 100% duty cycle transmitter. &nbsp; In fact, Motorola states in the manual that <u>the Mitrek is a 20-25% duty cycle radio</u>. &nbsp; Mobile radios inherently have undersized heat sinks, so to keep the heat rise down make sure you keep the output power at no more than half of the rated output (the lower the better, but Mitreks get dirty and squirrely if run too low). &nbsp; Obviously the lower the power on the same sized heat sink means the low power ones are preferred for repeat&nbsp;/&nbsp;link service - even a low power radio at half power is enough to drive an external amplifier to whatever power level you can afford. &nbsp; And pont-to-point links can use directional antennas... 5w into a 10db yagi gives the same performance as 50w into an omni with a lot less RF power involved, which means less DC power which means a smaller DC power supply and a lower AC power bill. &nbsp; The lower RF power also means you need less isolation in the antenna system, which translates into less duplexer is required...</p>

<p align="left">If you need a Mitrek manual please see <a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/moto-parts.html">this "How to Order Parts and Manuals" web page</a>. &nbsp; The 
low band, high band and UHF radios are pretty much the same in 
the non-RF areas, but the RF sections are different enough that 
you can't do much if you don't have the right manual... (besides, 
you'll need the right manual when it comes time to tune it up)<br>
In this manuals list below the "n" takes the place of a number 
that describes the transmitter power, explained later...

<ul compact>
<li> Low-band VHF - Tn1JJA - 25-54mhz - order part number 68-81045E65</li>
<li> Mid-band VHF - Tn2JJA - 66-88mhz - ???????????</li>
<li> High-band VHF - Tn3JJA - 136-174mhz - 68-81045E70</li> 
<li> UHF - Tn4JJA - 406-420 and 450-512mhz - 68-81045E75</li>
<li> 800/900mhz - Tn5JJA or Tn7JJA - ???????????<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (originally "5" meant 800/900mhz, at some point Moto switched to a "5" for 800mhz and a "7" to indicate 900mhz)</li>
</ul></p>

<p align="left">As long as your are ordering manuals, you will want to order 
the Mitrek tuning tool set, part number 66-82977K01 (unless you have a huge 
collection of diddle sticks - I have the standard 20-year collection that 
fills a large wooden cigar box.... even a piano tuner's wand for doing the old 
solenoid-tuned wide-spaced UHF Motracs). &nbsp; The real Mitrek tool is 
(as of May of 2004) only $2.92 and breaking a slug with the wrong tool is 
<u>not</u> worth three dollars.</p>

<p align="left">Unfortunately the "Mitrek Plus Supplement", part 
number is 68-81046E05 no longer available. &nbsp; The Plus series, 
according to the manual's introduction, "is a mobile radio intended 
for use in critical applications. &nbsp; It is similar to the basic 
Mitrek radio with enhanced specifications in three categories, 
(1) reduced transmitter distortion, (2) increased receiver selectivity, 
(3) increased audio power output with reduced distortion." &nbsp; The 
first and second are definitely attractive to repeater and link 
operations in the amateur radio world..., the last makes sense in 
a public safety environment - you'd want to be able to hear and 
understand the dispatcher when the siren is going...</p>

<p align="left">The "Plus Supplement" also notes that the Mitrek is 
an all-metric radio - don't casually mix the leftover screws into 
your parts bin.</p>

<p align="left">According to the supplement manual the 
differences in actual numbers are:<br>

<p>Despite the book saying that the UHF performance is the same, my personal 
experience is that it's noticeably better, I personally think that one of the 
"90db"s in the UHF Plus section is a rather critical typographical error.</p>

<p>The additional selectivity comes from adding a 5th 2-pole crystal filter, 
labeled as Y204 on the main circuit board, physically right in front of 
L206. &nbsp; The main boards were apparently designed for it all along, the 
early radios had a jumper (J201) in place of it.</p>

<p>The additional audio power output comes from using different (more powerful) 
audio PA devices and doubling the value of the two large electrolytic capacitors 
(physically located on the interconnect board) in series with the speaker to 
1,000uf.</p>

<p>The reduced transmitter and receiver distortion is accomplished by tuning 
with an audio distortion analyzer - the hardware is the same, the basic tuneup 
procesures are the same, they just do the fine tuning at the top of the peak 
or the bottom of the dip with the distortion analyzer. &nbsp; The old Heathkit 
distortion analyzers are on eBay all the time and you might want to consider 
picking one up. &nbsp; Get a manual also for the operational information... 
A lot of equipment can be used without reading the manual, a distortion analyzer 
fitrs into the category of "not really".</p>

<p>There are no external markings on the Mitrek indicating a Plus configuration 
over the standard configuration - and if you don't know exactly where 
to look for Y204 - that extra crystal filter - on the main board then the Plus 
radios can only be identified by the chassis number. &nbsp; The presence of 
the 1,000uf capacitors on the interconnect board is not always indicative... I've 
found the larger caps on interconnect boards in radios that didn't have the 
additional crystal filter.</p>

<p>Motorola made two different Mitrek mobile chassis castings: a low power 
with short fins and short PA deck area, and a high power with long fins and 
a deeper PA deck. &nbsp; Both fit into the same mobile mounting tray. &nbsp; Here 
are photos of both (they happen to be low band radios, but that's only coincidental):<br>

<p align=center>
<img src="pix/chassis-lp.jpg" border=0> &nbsp; &nbsp; <img 
src="pix/chassis-hp.jpg" border=0></p>

<p align="left">Motorola made some Mitreks with a bulged top lid that either: 
    <ul>
      <li>Held a large board that lay flat on top of the radio chassis and had 
        up to 24 channel elements on it, complete with TTL-based selection 
        logic to implement a 12-frequency radio. &nbsp; The board plugged 
	  into one of the existing channel element sockets and into the four 
	  frequency select lines on the main radio board. &nbsp; The control 
        head had the Syntor-style binary-coded 12-position frequency switch.
      </li>
      <li>Hid a flat-pack notch-only duplexer for some full duplex models.</li>
    </ul>
    In either case, the main board was 99% the same. &nbsp; I do not have any 
    manuals that show these models, so I don't know what codes to put in the model 
    chart for them. &nbsp; Here's a case where a reader with a well-stocked file 
    cabinet (or cabinets) can help.</p> 
    
<p>Motorola also made the "Super Consolette" - a tabletop base station that 
  was available with either a low power or a high power 12vDC supply mounted 
  internally. &nbsp; This base station had a regular mobile radio chassis 
  mounted internally and that chassis was totally complete except for a missing 
  model number / serial number tag. &nbsp; I have actually converted a 470mhz 
  base into a 52mhz base in under 15 minutes by doing no more than pulling 
  one radio chassis and mounting another. &nbsp; The consolette cabinet was 
  essentially a pretty box containing an AC power supply, the guts of a control 
  head, plus some other options, such as a DC or tone remote, a battery-backup 
  option on the internal power supply, channel-scan and a number of other 
  options. &nbsp; However the radio chassis that Moto shipped inside the 
  table-top base cabinets had different chassis numbers than the otherwise 
  identical mobiles. &nbsp; Go figure. &nbsp; I've also seen full duplex 
  Consolettes, and consolettes converted into desktop repeaters (there's 
  enough room under the radio chassis for a flat-pack duplexer, or even a 
  second radio chassis - as long as there is no DC or AC remote cards in 
  that space).</p>

<p>There are four power supply subchassis used in the "Super Consolette":
<ul>
<li>HPN 1003: high power, 120v 60hz only version of the HPN 1000</li>
<li>HPN 1001: low power, 120v 60hz only version of the HPN 1002</li>
<li>HPN 1000: high power, 120v / 220v / 240v, 50 / 60hz</li>
<li>HPN 1002: low power, 120v / 220v / 240v, 50 / 60hz</li>
</ul></p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>If the power supply chassis is stamped "TRN-6182" then it is 
a +12v only supply - not too common.</li>
<li>If there is a option board in the HPN1001 or HPN1002 power supply 
stamped "TLN-1274" then you have a backup battery reverting kit (which 
contains a +12v changeover relay and a trickle charger).</li>
</ul></p>
	  
    <p><blockquote><b>NOTE:</b>&nbsp;Out of a couple dozen units I have found two Super 
	Consolettes that had a 10.8mhz IF frequency! &nbsp;I don't know if this 
	was a factory option that never made it into the manuals or if these 
	were field converted (both came from locations that had two Consolettes 
	side by side on a desktop or tabletop). &nbsp; The consolette book I 
	have in my file cabinet does <u>not</u> list a 10.8mhz IF as a factory 
	option. &nbsp;If you suspect, even in the slightest, that your Mitrek 
	chassis might have been a base station at any point in it's career 
	CHECK THE IF FREQUENCY before you order the receive crystals. &nbsp; Just 
	check the part number on the side of any one of the IF crystal 
	filters. &nbsp; There is a list of 10.7mhz and 10.8mhz IF filter part 
	numbers in the Mitrek Interfacing writeup on this web site. &nbsp; My 
	older eyes need a dental mirror and a magnifying glass to do that - your 
	mileage may vary.</blockquote></p>
	 
<p align="left">Motorola radios have two sets of identifying 
    numbers: the model number and the chassis number. &nbsp; In 
the photo below you can faintly see the T44JJA-3000DK on the model 
number section of the nameplate and the HUE1082CPR chassis number 
stamped on the chassis lip. &nbsp; Yes, the "U" has a scratch through 
it and looks strange in the photo.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="pix/mitrek-model-and-chassis-numbers.jpg"></p>

<hr width=80% height=15 noshadow color=black>

    <p align="left">The low band book I have does not include the T71 models in 
      it - they jump from T61 to T81. &nbsp; Yet I have seen Mitrek mobile radios 
      with a T71 model label at two different hamfests, and the chassis number 
      was that of a T81 model. &nbsp; Strange.</p>

    <p align="left">In the option code the extender option is available only 
in the low band radios. &nbsp; Other product lines had high band extenders, but 
the Mitrek didn't.</p>

    <p align="left">The rest of the option code digits are very specific to the product line. 
      &nbsp; My Mitrek manuals list 000 and 900, and an email from VE1II provided 
	the 800 code: 
    <ul compact>
      <li>000 = single frequency</li>
	<li>800 = 12 frequency</li>
      <li>900 = 4 frequency</li>
    </ul>

	<p align="left">Bruce Harvey VE1II's email described some 12 frequency 
	Mitreks that were made with a domed lid that held a board with the 
	additional channel elements. &nbsp; The suffix on his radio is 1800B,  
	with the "1" indicating carrier squelch, the 8 indicating 12 frequency, 
	and the B indicating the chassis revision.</p>

	<p align="left">Except for the 12freq Mitrek mobiles the 000 and 900 means 
	nothing as all the radios were the same internally. &nbsp; The 000 means 
	that the radio was paired with a single frequency control group and the 
	900 means it was paired with a four-frequency control group. &nbsp; In 
	other words the  single frequency/multiple frequency difference was in 
	the control head, the control cable (extra wires), and the number 
	of channel elements that were shipped with the radio.</p>

	<p align="left">The first letter of the option code suffix is the 
	production line version or revision indicator. &nbsp; The Mitrek 
	started with the A version and the first change bumped it to the B version. 
      &nbsp; I have seen A, B, C and D version Mitrek low band radios, B version 
	high band radios, and C, D and E version UHF radios. &nbsp; There 
	are probably other versions out there. &nbsp; Every Mitrek Plus radio 
	I have seen has a version codes greater than "B".</p>
	  
<hr width=80% height=15 noshadow color=black>

    <p align="left"><b>Mitrek chassis numbers</b> are in the format of three or four 
      letters, four digits and a letter. The first two or three letters in a Mitrek 
      are always "HU" or "MHU". &nbsp; The next letter tells you the band. &nbsp; Next 
	there are 4 digits that are the actual chassis number. &nbsp; The trailing 
	letter tells you the chassis version. &nbsp; You will find the chassis number 
	stamped in black ink just inside the radio on the top of the metal case rim 
	above the latching handle and under the leading edge of the lid - see the 
	photo at the beginning of this article. &nbsp; You will want to take a copy 
	of the tables below with you when you go hamfesting... I personally have a 
	copy in my Palm Pilot.</p>

    <blockquote> 
      <p align="full"><font size=+1><b>NOTE:</b> <u>I have no other information 
	on any chassis numbers not listed</u></font> - everything below came from 
	my Mitrek manuals or from contributed information. &nbsp; Missing information 
	is marked with a "??". &nbsp; If anybody has additional chassis numbers to 
	add, please send them to me but please include at least the model number, 
	and a physical description (long chassis or short chassis, frequency range, 
	4-freq or 12-freq, with or without duplexer, with or without preamp, with 
	or without extender (low band only), the TX power level, etc) - in other 
	words, enough info that I can figure out what you have well enough that 
	I can add it to the list.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p align="left">Chassis numbers starting with: 
    <ul>
      <li>MHUB / HUB are low band (25-54mhz) equivalent to a T&lt;power descriptor number&gt;1 model 
        number prefix</li>
      <li>MHUC / HUC are mid band (66-88mhz) equivalent to a Tn2 model number prefix</li>
      <li>MHUD / HUD are high band (136-174mhz) equivalent to a Tn3 model number prefix</li>
      <li>MHUE / HUE are UHF band (403-512mhz) equivalent to a Tn4 model number prefix</li>
	<li>MHUF / HUF are 800/900mhz equivalent to a Tn5 or Tn7 model number prefix</li>
    </ul>
	</p>

    <p align="left">If you have a long-chassis radio that has only one set of channel elements the odds are that you have a 800mhz or 900mhz radio. &nbsp; I am not including any information on the those units below as I have no manual(s) on them. &nbsp; If anybody has a spare manual and wants to send it to me I'll write something up. &nbsp; At least xerox the model number and option tables and send them to me.</p>

<p>In the tables below "Reverse Engineered" numbers are those that appear in the field but are not in any manual. &nbsp; If you find one and can figure it out, send it in and I'll add it.</p>

    <p>Notes:<br>1) The Consolette base chassis numbers came from a 
revision "O" base manual. &nbsp; High band preamps and higher-numbered 
chassis were not in the manual. &nbsp; Nor were they in the "O" high 
band mobile manual I looked in.<br>
2) The 75 and 100 watt high band chassis are the same. &nbsp; Only 
the setting of the power output control is different. &nbsp; The 
same holds true for the 75, 90 and 110 watt UHF radios.<br>
3) The factory preamp was not that good - if your Mitrek didn't have one don't 
bother trying to find one. &nbsp; An <a href="http://www.anglelinear.com">Anglelinear preamp</a> is much, much better.</p>

<hr width=80% height=15 noshadow color=black>

<p align="left">For UHF amateur radio repeater purposes we are primarily interested 
  in the 450 to 470 Mhz range radios. &nbsp; The 406-420 radios make good 420-430mhz 
  link radios, and are highly prized. &nbsp; Several folk I know are using Mitreks 
  for link radios in the 420-440mhz range of the UHF band. &nbsp; They report 
  that most every 450-470mhz Mitrek they've tried has gone as low as 431mhz, sometimes 
  430mhz with good RX and TX performance. &nbsp; However if you are planning to 
  use a Mitrek in the 420-430mhz range you really need to look for a 406-420mhz Mitrek. 
  &nbsp; On the other hand the 470-494mhz, 494-512mhz and 470-512mhz radios make 
  pretty good doorstops, especially the high power ones.</p>

<p align="left">Note that there is a "breakpoint" on the chassis number 
line between the Mitrek and Mitrek Plus radios... with the low band radios 
it is somewhere between 1032 and 1043, with the high band radios it's in 
between 1031 and 1053, and on UHF it's between 1053 and 1073. &nbsp; If 
you find a chassis labled HUE1090 it's probably going to be a Plus radio. 
&nbsp; You can verify that by looking for crystal filter Y204 and seeing 
if it is a filter or a jumper.</p>

<p align="left">When you buy your Mitreks, look for ones with the channel 
  elements in them. &nbsp; These are little flat plug in aluminum modules that 
  have the crystal and the oscillator circuit in them. &nbsp; If you have a 
  choice be sure to grab a Plus radio (lok for the extra crystal filter) with 
  the elements in it! &nbsp; More info on this is in the <a href="mitrek-interfacing.html">Mitrek Interfacing web page</a>.</p>

<p align="left">If the frequency label on the channel is missing, make sure you 
verify the channel element model number - I learned the hard way - I once purchased 
a low-band Mitrek that came with a pair of UHF elements that had the frequency tags 
very carefully removed...</p>

See <a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/mitrek/mitrek-channel-elements.html">the Mitrek / MSR channel element page</a> for more information.
