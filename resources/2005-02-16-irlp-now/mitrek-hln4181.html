Look for the authors email info at the end...</p>

<p align="left">There was a discussion on the Mitrek HLN4181 reedless board 
and the associated TLN4224 tone elements on the repeater-builder mailing list 
a long time ago, and this writeup is a enhancement (in reality almost a total 
rewrite) of my posting on that topic... &nbsp; basically I deleted some 
irrelevant information and added some additional information I had since 
generated. &nbsp; The second major revision happened when I added the photos.</p>

<blockquote><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>When you print this file make sure that the 
diagrams below come out in a monospaced font (like Courier) if you want 
to see the diagrams below properly. &nbsp; I used an exclamation point as 
a vertical line since the actual vertical line character is one of the first 
ones replaced by a local language character in non-USA keyboards... I wanted
this writeup to be as international-compatible as possible. </blockquote>

<p align="left">This writeup was generated using a 40w UHF Mitrek and one 
each of the HLN-4020 reed board and the HLN4181 reedless board as test beds, 
but since the PL boards are universal to all the Mitrek models the fact that
I used a UHF radio shouldn't matter.</p>

<p align="left"><a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/moto-parts.html%22">If you need a Mitrek manual read this web page</a>. &nbsp; The manuals are about US$30 each and <a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/rbtip/mitrek-index.html">the manual part numbers are on this web page</a>.</p>

<p align="left">The Mitrek Plus supplement is 68-81046E05 and is definitely 
worth getting if you can get one... &nbsp; the last time I called they were 
out of them and not going to reprint it. &nbsp; As long as you have Motorola
parts ordering dept. on the phone you will want to order the Mitrek tuning 
tool, part number 66-82977K01. &nbsp; The real Mitrek tool is (in May of 
2004) only $2.92 and breaking a slug with the wrong tool is <u>not</u> worth 
it.  &nbsp; Note also that the Mitrek is an all-metric radio - don't casually 
mix the leftover screws into your parts bin.</p>

<p align="left">Another note... the UHF book that I have (68-81045E70-A) 
is the only Mitrek manual I have found that has documentation on all 
three PL/DPL boards&nbsp;-&nbsp;the HLN-4020 reed-type PL board, the HLN-4181 
element-type PL board and the HLN-4011 DPL board. &nbsp; These three boards 
are completely interchangeable - the most you might have to do if you swap 
a reed PL board for an element PL board or for a DPL or vice versa is to 
adjust the encoder level. &nbsp; The highband book I looked at seems to be 
incomplete - it was missing the HLN-4020 reed-type board schematic. &nbsp; The 
low-band book I have in my file cabinet (a -O original version) has the HLN4020 
reed board and the DPL 2-code adapter, but no DPL board or the HLN4181 reedless 
tone PL board.</p>

<p align="left">Note also that Moto uses a -O for the Original release of a manual, 
a -A is the first revision, and they work their way up the alphabet, skipping the 
letter O when they get to it. &nbsp; After -Z they continue with -AA, -AB, -AC, and 
so forth to AZ then BA...etc.</p>

<p align="left">This document started in late 1998 / early 1999 with a request 
for a TRN-4224 element for the HLN-4181 PL board that was posted on the mailing 
list...</p>

<p align="left">My response started with:<br>

>&nbsp;I bought a tone element for 127.3hz from Telepath in San Jose (south of <br>
>&nbsp;San Francisco in California) last week. They are at 800-292-1700, they <br>
>&nbsp;take credit cards over the phone, and will ship parcel post, ground UPS, <br>
>&nbsp;FedEx and next-day UPS.<br>
>&nbsp;Obligatory disclaimer - I have no relation to them except as a satisfied, <br>
>&nbsp;in fact, very satisfied, repeat customer.<br>
--&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>For what it's worth, Telepath has since put up a web site at <a href="http://www.telepathcorp.com">http://www.telepathcorp.com</a></p>

<p align="left">The rest of my response to the inquiry was how to roll 
your own element from a few resistors, and was about half of the material 
that is below. &nbsp; Kevin W3KKC later emailed me and asked if I would 
write it up for his web site, so I did, and the first version was 
posted. &nbsp; That was over a dozen revisions ago. &nbsp; Happy 
reading!</p>

For reference, pin 9 is at the top, nearest the only 8-pin IC on the board.</p>

<p align="left">The HLN-4020 reed-type board uses one each KLN6209 and KLN6210 
reeds and in perusing the board's schematic I did notice one nice feature that 
I've not seen in any other reed-based PL board: it can be jumpered to use one 
reed for a common encode/decode tone or two reeds for split tones. &nbsp; When 
two reeds are used the encode reed is on the left of the hold-down bracket in the 
above picture with the decode reed on the right, when one reed is used it goes 
in the encoder socket and two jumpers are added. &nbsp; The necessary jumpers 
are documented in the later schematics of the board (they are not included in 
the board revision D schematic but they are there are in revision F). &nbsp; An 
early board can be jumpered for a single reed using the info from the later 
schmatic.</p>

<p align="left">If you can't find the reeds you need on the frequency you need, 
the HLN-4020 board seems to be just as happy with any of the following 
reeds (I've tried all of them at one point or another):

<ul compact>
<li>Bramco A0186B (could have been A01868 - the label on the side of the reed was dinged)</li>
<li>KLN6209 (this is the number that the Mitrek book calls for, this one 
is also specified in the later Micor mobile books as the encode reed). &nbsp; It 
seems to be a plastic-cased (i.e. lower manufacturing cost) version of a TLN6824 
reed.</li>
<li>K-1000</li>
<li>KLN-6210 (this is specified as the decode reed in the Mitrek book, but I 
have substituted K-1000s, TLN6824s and KLN-6209s in place of it with no change 
in performance - in fact it behaves as if the '09 and '10 are the same internally)</li>
<li>TLN6709 (I've found these in HT-220s)</li>
<li>TLN6824 (the encode reed specified in the late Motrac and early Micor books)</li>
<li>TLN8381 (the fat decode reeds from later Motracs and Micors)</li>.  
</ul>
You do have to remove the hold-down bracket (one screw) to create enough clearance 
to use the fat decode reeds in the HLN4020, so don't use one in a mobile as the 
reed will fall out into the receive circuitry (if you haven't been inside a Mitrek 
the normal mounting position has the PL board upside down over the receiver), but 
in a pinch the fat decode reed will work just fine as either as a decode or an 
as an encode reed...</p>

<p align="left">If you are looking for a HLN-4181 board, at the time of 
this writing they were in stock for $20 each at C. W. Wolfe Electronics, 
a used 2-way radio dealer in Billings Montana at 406-252-9220. &nbsp; They 
also have the HLN-4011 DPL board for $10. &nbsp; Note that this is not 
an endorsement by repeater-builder.com, I'm just mentioning it as a 
service. &nbsp; I have to say this - like I said in the above email I have 
no relation to C. W. Wolfe company except as a very satisfied repeat customer.</p>

<p align="left">Note that the HLN-4181 reedless board cannot do split tones 
due to it's inherent design - the circuitry can only decode the same tone 
as it encodes due to the fact that the encoder is used as the frequency 
reference for the decoder. &nbsp; On the web page that I created describing 
<a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/mitrek/mitrekinterfacing.html">how 
to interface a Mitrek to a repeater controller</a> I've included a schematic of 
how to connect a separate encoder.</p>

<p align="left"><b>HOWEVER...</b> If all you need is a different encode tone, 
and can live with the decoder not decoding it's intended tone while transmitting,
well... looking at the HLN-4181 schematic it appears that the custom chip that 
is used on the board was designed to use two tone element sockets and switch 
between them (look at pins 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of schematic 68-80200W-06)... 
Just tack a tone element socket (ordered from Moto as a replacement part 
or scavenged from a dead board) onto the foil side of the board with a dab 
of <u>acid-free</u> clear RTV, add some jumpers (I'd use wire-wrap wire) 
to parallel all the pins except pins 1 and 2 to the existing socket, clone 
the choke and resistor combination that is on pins 12 and 15 onto pins 13 
and 14, and slave the "code select" pin to PTT (in the stock form the pin is 
grounded, just unplug the chip, bend pin 16 to clear the socket, and tack 
a piece of wirewrap wire to it and run it to a 22k pullup resistor and a 
.05uf cap to ground, and to your PTT) .... &nbsp; Look at the schematic 
and trace what I have written above... &nbsp; I've not tested this but it 
looks like it should work... just remember that your decoder will follow 
your encoder tone.</p>

<p align="left">Until I found the tone element I needed at Telepath, a friend 
of mine and I were reverse engineering the HLN-4181 PL board and the 
associated TRN4224 tone element because we couldn't find a 127.3hz 
element in the junk boxes of any of the usual suspects, and in our 
application we absolutely had to have 127.3hz and we had to have 
reverse burst (which precluded a Com-Spec TS-32). &nbsp; We were 90%-95% 
done when another friend found out about our project and called and told me 
about Telepath, gave me their phone number, said he had done a lot of 
business with them and was very happy with them. &nbsp; I called them, they 
had what I needed at a reasonable price, they had a couple of other items I 
wanted and hadn't been able to find anywhere else, so I gave them my credit card 
number... &nbsp; Yes, at that point I knew enough about the board's design 
to make a 127.3hz element, but this was for a radio that was going to a 
repeater site that I can't get to very often. &nbsp; We were also in a bit of a 
rush, we had to get this unit in service in a couple of weeks - not much time 
for a burn-in. &nbsp; All in all, for the cost of the element involved 
(under $15) it wasn't worth risking a future middle-of-winter failure with a 
homebrew element... &nbsp; and other parts of the project needed the time 
we had left.</p>

<p align="left">That caveat said, if you need to you can "roll your own" 
element with nothing more than a bunch of 1/4 watt, 1/8 watt or 1/10 watt 100k 
resistors (the smaller the physical size the better), some solder and some 
electrical tape. &nbsp; The TLN4224 element is simply a variable number of 
resistors (from 1 to 10 depending on the tone) that are used to program a 
counter.</p>

<p align="left">In the process of reverse engineering the HLN-4181 board 
my friend and I discovered that the tone generator is based on a 10-bit 
binary counter that is preloaded with a number that is held by the element 
(see the schematic below) as two 5-bit nibbles. &nbsp; The nibbles are selected 
by alternately strobing pin 1 or pin 2 of the element socket. &nbsp; Once the 
10-bit number gets into the counter it counts up to overflow then reloads 
the starting number and does it again... &nbsp; The higher the starting number 
the more frequent the overflow resulting in a higher tone frequency generated.</p>

<p align="left">The encoder audio output is smoothed and filtered before 
injection into the transmitter. &nbsp; When the incoming PTT line goes inactive 
the encoder generates the reverse burst, then drops the outgoing PTT line. &nbsp; This 
takes care of the encoder function.</p>

<p align="left">The decode function is accomplished by passing the RX audio 
through a low-pass filter that passes only the PL frequencies and feeding it 
to another part of the custom chip which uses the encoder as a frequency 
reference and checks for a matching frequency from the receiver audio. &nbsp; If 
there is a match it unmutes the receiver by way of JU-4 or JU-5.</p>

<p align="left">There is also an audio notch filter on the board to remove the 
received PL tone from the received audio. &nbsp; However you don't want to try 
to use it in repeater service - just plan on using an external high-pass filter
betweek the receiver and your repeater controller.</p>

<p align="left">The HLN4181 board will encode and decode simulataneously (like 
in a duplex radio) as long as you encode and decode the same tone. &nbsp; As I 
described in the "However..." paragraph above you can modify the HLN4181 to do 
split tones (one tone on TX the other on RX) if you want to. &nbsp; If you want 
simultaneous split tones just use an HLN-4020 dual reed board with the appropriate 
pair of reeds, or use a separate encoder. &nbsp; There is detailed info on how to 
set up split tones using the HLN4181 and a separate encoder 
on <a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/mitrek/mitrekinterfacing.html">my 
Mitrek Interfacing page</a>.</p>

<p align="left">Note that on the TRN4224 tone element that there is no physical 
pin in location 4. &nbsp; In fact the socket has a plastic block there - it's used 
as a key to prevent people from inserting the element backwards. &nbsp; And while 
there is a pin in location 3 it is not actively used in the TRN4224 tone element 
(but it's grounded on the PL board). &nbsp; I assume that it's connected to the 
substrate inside the tone element.</p>

them just for simplifying this writeup.</p>

<p align="left">As you can see you can make your own element by inserting
resistor leads into the socket and bussing the top leads of the two sets of 
resistors together and inserting the busses into pin 1 and pin 2.</p>

<p align="left">My friend and I started with elements for the three different 
frequencies we had in stock, and determined the resistor pattern inside each 
element with a VOM (every resistor was about 100k, ranging from 85k to 115k), 
and created a table of tone frequencies versus data bits. &nbsp; We also 
determined that with no element inserted the encoder produced 273.3hz when 
the TX is keyed.</p>

<p align="left">As another source of information in the reverse-engineering attempt 
we also used a single 100k resistor and inserted it in the socket pins - i.e. from 
pin 2 to pin 5 for resistor A, and noted the frequency that was generated when PTT 
was keyed, then from 2 to 6 for resistor B and remeasure, then from 2 to 7 for 
resistor C, all the way to resistor J from pins 1 to 13. &nbsp; We noted the 
frequency change that each pin produced by itself:</p>

<p align="left">So pick a frequency, figure out what the difference 
between it and 273.3 is, then figure out the bits you need to activate 
to get that difference, and program it in (or you can cheat and look 
at the table at the end of this writeup).  Just plug the resistors 
into pins 5 to 13 and buss the appropriate top ends to pins 1 or 2.  
A flap of electrical tape over the strobe busses takes care of any 
insulation requirements. For pin 9 (resistors E and F) solder the two 
bottom leads together and clip one lead short &ndash; do <u>not</u> try 
to plug both leads into the pin in the socket. &nbsp; If you want 
some physical rigidity slop a big glob of some acid-free clear RTV 
onto the resistors. &nbsp; If you want some shielding (usually not 
required) just fold a flap of copper foil (available at model airplane 
hobby shops) over the hardened RTV and solder a trimmed piece of a 
resistor lead (or a short piece of #24 wire) to it and plug the wire 
tail into pin 3 (ground). &nbsp; If you chose to use RTV, make sure you 
get the <i>acid-free</i> clear RTV &ndash; check the label! &ndash; most 
of the common brands give off acetic acid fumes as they cure and that 
will eat up your solder connections - and the damage will be hidden 
inside the hardened RTV! (This <u>is</u> the voice of experience 
with Permatex #66...)</p>

<p align="left">One advantage to the HLN4181 - you can have a Mitrek 
on each end with NO tone element installed (i.e. set to 273.3hz) and 
they can talk to each other. &nbsp; The higher frequency tone also 
means minimum pickup delay. &nbsp; This is ideal on point-to-point 
links (and it saves having to make up any elements). &nbsp; Yes, the 
273hz tone is harder to filter out than a lower frequency,  but it 
can be done with an active filter.</p>

<p align="left">The HLN-4181 PL board also allows you to pick weird 
or non-standard tones in 0.3hz steps from 273.3 on down, but to make
them workable you need these PL boards on both ends... &nbsp; this 
trick can be handy on point-to-point links that you want to keep 
the riff-raff out of (if you don't mind the PL pick-up delay - a 
lot of links use carrier squelch to minimize the delay that comes 
from cascaded links). Maybe 199.2 hz anybody? &nbsp; Or 235.0 
hz? &nbsp; However, you have to remember that PL (or Digital PL) 
doesn't solve interference issues, it just covers them up. &nbsp; Sure, 
the RX won't unsquelch if it is requiring a weird tone and the idiot 
only has the standard tones but the idiot can still sit there and 
transmit on the channel causing a heterodyne or capturing / blocking 
the receiver, so what real security (or increase in usability) have 
you really gained? &nbsp; And what prevents a determined and 
resourceful idiot from listening to you on the input with an 
OptoElectronics tone grabber and finding your weird magic 
tone ? &nbsp; (it only takes maybe 5 seconds of signal). &nbsp; But if 
you feel like playing around with this concept you can also build up 
a test jig by taking ten resistors, a ten-position DIP switch and some 
wire and hooking them up as follows:
