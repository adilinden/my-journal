<blockquote><b>Note:</b> If you decide to print this file to put 
in your Mitrek manual make sure that the circuit diagrams below 
show up in a monospaced font (like Courier) if you want to see 
them properly. &nbsp; I used an exclamation point as a vertical 
line since the actual vertical line character (upper-case backslash 
on many keyboards) is one of the first ones replaced by a local 
language character in non-USA keyboards and as a rule I make my 
writeups as international-compatible as possible.
</blockquote>

<p align="left">This writeup discusses how to modify any common 
Motorola Mitrek mobile two-way radio to add connections for a repeater 
controller. &nbsp; These modifications are frequency independent - all 
they affect are audio and controls (push-to-talk, etc) and were 
originally developed for a dual UHF radio configuration (one for 
receive, the other for transmit) that implemented one end of a full 
duplex point-to-point link, but will work on any regular single Mitrek 
radio, a duplexed Mitrek, a tabletop base (Motorola calls it a "Super 
Consolette"), a tabletop base converted into a repeater or dual Mitrek 
configuration, even in mobile extender usage.</p>

<p>I started this mod writeup as a set of handwritten notes on 
ruled paper in the back of my Mitrek binder as I read through 
the Mitrek manual. &nbsp; Then I got my hands on some surplus 
Mitreks, and Googled every mention of "Mitrek" and "modify" or 
"modification" or "repeater" or "remote base" on the internet 
and printed the articles. &nbsp; Then I reverse engineered every 
mod to see what it did, and on some I tried them out - for example 
audio mods were tested using a HP-200CD generator swept from 100hz 
to 5khz and a Heathkit distortion analyzer. &nbsp; This writeup 
is the result of my experiments and experiences.</p>

<p>All of this work was done in a negative ground environment. &nbsp; The 
Mitrek mobile radio itself can be cabled for either positive or negative 
ground, but if you are using this info to help you build a mobile extender 
in a positve ground environment please realize that you are plowing a new 
field and are on your own. &nbsp; In all my years of working on commercial 
two-way radios I can count the number of positive ground installations 
I've been involved with on one hand and have multiple fingers left over.</p>

<p align="left">The reason I used Mitreks in my system was that the Mitrek 
is an excellent performer, readily available, inexpensive (because everybody 
wants synthesized radios like Maxtracs where the Mitrek uses crystals - in 
fact it was the last crystal controlled mobile that Motorola made), and it 
is easy to work on (it uses pin and hole components instead of surface mount).</p>

<p align="left">I used dual radios since you can't duplex 406-420mhz Mitreks 
and keep them clean, so my initial implementation used two 450 Mitreks tuned 
to the regular user input and output frequencies of the far-end repeater (443 
and 448mhz), later replaced by 420mhz Mitreks on real link frequencies.</p>

<p align="left">This is a "cafeteria collection" of modifications - no 
one mod is dependent on any other mod - you can pick and chose which 
ones you want to implement. &nbsp; If you are going to use two radios 
to implement a repeater or a duplex link, I suggest you make the mods 
to both radios leaving half of each radio idle so that if something 
dies and you are in a pinch you can simply swap the radios and be back 
on the air, then at your leisure swap out the half dead radio with a 
good spare. &nbsp; Note that this means that to implement your first 
one-way point-to-point link you need to buy at least four radios... one 
for TX at site #1, one for RX at site #2, one for a shelf spare, and 
one to blow up while getting familiar with the Mitrek (and then to use 
for spare parts to keep the other three running). &nbsp; You can also 
make the same four radios a duplex link, as long as they aren't 406-420 
radios. &nbsp; If you are implementing your first Mitrek-based 420mhz 
full duplex link you will need six... (a pair at the near end, a pair at the 
far end, a shelf spare and the sacrificial lamb...).</p>

<p align="left">There is some deliberate repetition in this text - please 
excuse that as you read it, but since I wrote this document as a cafeteria 
collection a few things need to be mentioned in each relevant section. &nbsp; Even 
with this separation into individual mods I recommend that you read this entire 
document all the way through at least once before you heat up the soldering 
iron.</p>

<p>Make sure that you have a correctly working radio, on the frequency 
of interest before you start the mods. &nbsp; You don't want to start 
modifying a radio, and when it's done dicover it's not working, and 
you don't know if it's the radio or the mods that are messed up.</p>

<p align="left">I guarantee that you will also find typos, and at no 
extra charge. &nbsp; A lot of these 43 pages were done late at night 
after everyone else had gone to bed. &nbsp; I don't mind emails pointing 
them out, either. &nbsp; And to update one of my dad's old jokes, 
the new PC keyboard can't spell any better than the old one (he was 6AAU 
at age 14, let it lapse when he moved to Toronto, then relicensed in the 
late 1970s as WB6SOX... was an old time newspaperman and a professional 
photographer... the original joke referred to when he upgraded his office 
from an <a href="http://www.officemuseum.com/Underwood_No._5_OM.JPG">Underwood 
mechanical typewriter</a> to a Smith-Corona portable typewriter in about 
1967-1968 and then to a dual-pitch IBM Selectric in 1981 or so).</p>

<p align="left">The modifications described in this document are generic 
and nothing in the repeater controller needs to be adapted to the radio, 
with one exception: if you plan on using the the stock Mitrek carrier 
squelch to drive the COR / COS / carrier detect line (the signal to the 
controller) then the controller has to be able to mute the receiver audio 
which some of the ACC controllers couldn't do (they relied on the receiver 
audio muting). &nbsp; There was a mod for the ACC that used the fact that 
driving the reset line of the audio delay board chip with the COR signal 
would mute the audio, but that wasn't well documented or distributed. &nbsp; If 
you use the Link-Comm RLC-MOT board to add a Micor squelch to the radio then 
even this concern is eliminated.</p>

<p align="left">The dual radio setup described here has been personally tested 
by me on three different controllers, one was home-brew Z80-based, the second 
was a home-brew PIC processor, and the third was an Scom 7K. &nbsp; Emails 
have reported that this information has been used on several single simplex 
and duplexed mobiles (used as remote bases), several more dual radio 
combinations (used as point-to-point links), and at least two full 
duplex tabletop base stations, and with controllers by Creative Control, 
Computer Automation ("CAT"), Link (RLC-series), Pacific Research and NHRC, 
so I am confident that there are no hidden problems in this procedure.</p>

<p align="left">Note that everyone who plans on using a UHF Mitrek in 
repeater or link service should read (and then re-read) the excellent 
Cactus Radio writeup on these radios located at 
<a href="http://www.cactus-intertie.org/LA/tec_not5.pdf">http://
www.cactus-intertie.org/LA/tec_not5.pdf</a>.</p>

<p align="left">I keep my Mitrek manuals in a large 3-ring binder and also 
included are doc sheets on my mods plus printouts of various Mitrek related 
web pages. &nbsp; <u>You should print the Cactus Radio writeup, read it, 
3-hole punch it, and put it in >>your<< Mitrek book - it is a very well 
done writeup and is full of excellent technical info</u>. &nbsp; There is 
one conflict between Cactus's writeup and this one, they bring repeat audio 
out on the connector pin that I use for the PL decode logic level, but please 
read both sets of info and make your own choice on signal routing. &nbsp; I 
especially call your attention to page 4 of the Cactus writeup concerning 
the transmitter tuneup precedure and capacitor C-800L (that's C-eight 
hundred-L). &nbsp; I lost two UHF transmitters before I discovered that 
quirk...</p>

<p align="left">These mods were developed using a pair of T34JJA 30w UHF 
Mitrek radios as test beds. &nbsp; The radios started out life as mobiles 
on a 464mhz and 469mhz commercial community repeater frequency pair (chassis 
numbers HUE1074C and HUE1082C). &nbsp; For a model and chassis number lookup 
list see the web page at <a 
href="mitrek-modnum.html">http://www.repeater-builder.com/mitrek/mitrekmodnum.html</a>. &nbsp; If you have a Mitrek 
chasssis number that is not listed there please send me full information 
so I can add it. &nbsp; <u>Please don't email me asking about any chassis 
number not listed</u> - all the info I have is already up on the web 
page. &nbsp; Note that many of the Mitrek chassis are very similar - for 
example, the same high power chassis can have any of 8 different chassis 
numbers depending on if the receiver preamp was factory installed or not, 
and if the output power control variable resistor was set to 60, 75, 90 or 
100 watts.</p>

<p align="left">I have low band, UHF and consolette manuals, and before 
web-ifying this writeup I compared them to a friend's high band manual, 
mainly to make sure the component designators for the resistors, 
capacitors, jumpers, etcetera that I mention here did not change between 
manuals. &nbsp; Since these mods only affect the audio and squelch circuits 
they should transfer over with no problems, but they have not been tried on 
actual low band or high band hardware (yet) &nbsp; (June 2003 update: I have 
since received emails from four different folks that have converted low band 
and high band radios using this information and they state that everything 
matches). &nbsp; And there is now a highband manual in the file cabinet.</p>

The Mitrek "Super Consolette" tabletop base radio has it's own supplement 
manual: 68-81040E80. &nbsp; You <u>don't</u> need this manual to do any 
of the mods listed here, but if you end up with a tabletop Mitrek base it's 
very, very nice to have, especially if your unit has any options like 
DC (or AC) wireline remote control, VU meter, battery back up or channel 
scan (yes, Moto offered a scanning base station). &nbsp; Note that you 
need the appropriate mobile manual (low band, high band, UHF, 800mhz) 
to go along with it as the Mitrek tabletop base is simply a pretty box 
that contains the power supply, the volume and squelch controls, the 
frequency switch, a speaker, a 1:1 audio transformer (between the 
Mitrek chassis and the speaker) and a mobile radio chassis. &nbsp; And 
if you end up with the high power (i.e. the larger) power supply then 
you can run a low power tabletop repeater. &nbsp; The chassis even has 
a hole for a second antenna jack pre-punched (then hidden behind a label).</p>

<p align="left">As long as your are ordering manuals, you will want to 
order the Mitrek tuning tool set, part number 66-82977K01 (unless you 
have a huge collection of diddle sticks - I have the standard 20-year 
collection that fills a wooden cigar box.... even a piano tuner's wand 
for doing the old solenoid-tuned wide-spaced UHF Motracs). &nbsp; The 
real Mitrek tool is only $2.92 (as of May 2004) and breaking a slug with 
the wrong tool is not worth it.</p>

<p align="left">The Mitrek Plus supplement is 68-81046E05 and is definitely 
worth getting if you can get one... &nbsp; the last time I called they 
were out of them and not planning to reprint them.</p>

<p align="left">For more information on manuals and how to order them, see 
the <a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/rbtip/motparts.html">"How to 
order manuals or parts from Motorola"</a> web page that can be reached 
from the main Motorola page. &nbsp; The <a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/motorola/motorola-suffixes.html">"Figuring out what you have"</a> 
page can also be useful.<p>

<p align="left">Another note... the UHF book that I have (68-81045E75-A) is 
the only Mitrek manual I have in my collection that has documentation on 
all three PL and DPL boards&nbsp;-&nbsp;the HLN-4020 reed-type PL board, 
the HLN-4181 "reedless" (also known as the "tone-element") PL board and 
the HLN-4011 DPL board. &nbsp; And the late UHF book - the 68-81045E75-B 
does not have the HLN-4181 board in it!</p>

<p align="left">The -A revision highband book I looked at does not 
have a HLN-4020 reed-type board schematic. &nbsp; There may be a 
newer rev out there.</p>

<p align="left">The -O original low-band book I have does not have the 
HLN4181 reedless PL board or the DPL board documentation. &nbsp; There 
may be a newer rev out there.</p>

<p align="left">Note also that the Mitrek is an all-metric radio - don't 
casually mix the leftover screws into your parts bin.</p>

<hr width=80% height=15 noshade noshadow color=black>

<p align="left">
<b>Now I'm going to define some terms that I'll use in the rest 
of this writeup:</b>
<ul>
<li>The "main board" is the big unified RX-TX board in the radio.</li>

<li>The "control connector" is the radio front panel connector 
that the control cable plugs into, and on the other end of the 
control cable is the control head, speaker, microphone and microphone 
hang-up clip (which has a switch in it to disable the PL decoder 
when the mic is removed from the clip).</li>

<li>The "interconnect board" is the PC board that sits behind the front 
panel of the radio at a right angle to the main board. &nbsp; This 
board plugs into the main board and the control connector is 
soldered onto it.<br>
Note: &nbsp; Sometimes the main-board-to-interconnect-board 
contacts get dirty and strange things happen - if your radio 
starts to act weird one day just power it off, then unplug 
and plug in the interconnect board a dozen times and power 
it up. &nbsp; The symptoms will probably go away for a year 
or two.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Lastly, be aware that the same jumper number can appear in 
multiple places - there can be a JU3, for example, on the main 
board, another JU3 on the interconnect board, a third JU3 on 
the PL board and maybe a fourth JU3 in the control head. &nbsp; I've 
made a point of specifying where a specific jumper is when I mention 
it, but keep this in mind, especially if you are reading someone 
elses writeup.</p>

<hr width=80% height=15 noshade noshadow color=black>

<p align="left">
Since a repeater or a point-to-point link is a single frequency 
beast the four frequency select leads plus the "SP" (spare) 
lead in the cable (pin 18 - the middle big pin) are available 
for reuse as input and output pins. &nbsp; Note that there is 
a 0.01uf capacitor between the F1 lead (pin 7) and ground (at 
C602). &nbsp; If you are going to reuse that pin, you might 
want to remove C602, depending in how you use it. &nbsp; If 
yes, it's right next to the Frequency #1 transmit channel 
element.</p>

<p align="left">
There are two versions of the Mitrek: the early "Mitrek" and 
the later "Mitrek Plus", however you can't tell which one you 
have without looking at the radio's interior or looking at the 
chassis number. &nbsp; The differences are fully documented in 
the Mitrek Plus supplement manual I mentioned above and among 
other things the "Plus" radios have extra IF filtering and some 
filtering chokes on the control cable pins. &nbsp; The Mitrek 
Plus really is the preferred radio when you go hunting for 
Mitreks. &nbsp; Not that the regular Mitrek isn't a fine radio, 
just if you have the opportunity to paw through a pile of radios 
it makes no sense not to pick the better ones...</p>

<p align="left">To determine which version you have you will have 
to do one of the following: 
<ol compact>
<li>Look at the chassis number (the 
<a href="mitrek-modnum.html">Mitrek 
Chassis and Model Numbers web page</a> lists all the ones that 
I know of)<br>
<br>
<table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 align=full width=520>

<td align=left valign=top><center>
<img src="pix/mitrek-model-and-chassis-numbers.jpg" 
width=501 height=350></center><br>
Photo 1: In this photo you can see the HUE1082CPR chassis number 
stamped on the chassis lip. &nbsp; On this particular radio the 
"U" looks strange in the photo because it has a screwdriver 
scratch through it.</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
</li>

<li>Look for Y204 - the extra receiver IF crystal filter:<br>

<table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 align=full width=420>
<tr>
<td align=left valign=top><center>
<img src="pix/mitrek-missing-IF-filter.jpg"></center><br>
Photo 2: This is a Mitrek - the pen points to 
the jumper that replaces the filter (this is 
a carrier squelch radio - no PL board - note 
the red connector at the bottom left - this 
is where the PL board plugs in.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align=left valign=top><center>
<img src="pix/mitrek-extra-IF-filter.jpg"></center><br>
Photo 3: This is a Mitrek Plus - the black pen points to the 
extra filter - (yes, this radio has a HLN 4020 dual reed 
PL board in it). &nbsp; If you need to add Y204 to a 
radio it's Moto part number 48-84396K02.</td>
</tr></table><br>
</li>
 
<li>Look the back side of the interconnect board around the 
back of control connector for several RF chokes. &nbsp; In a 
number of places where the interconnect board silk screen has 
JU (for jumper) the Mitrek has a wire jumper and the Mitrek 
Plus has a choke - but not always. &nbsp; The later interconnect 
boards had the "L" designation in the silk-screened labeling, the 
earlier boards had the "JU". &nbsp; There were Mitrek Pluses made 
with L-designations and jumpers in place.  &nbsp; Finding a radio 
with chokes  is nice, but a later board (with L-designations) is 
better (chokes are easy to make and can be added).<br>
<br>

Photo 5A: This is the front side of a later interconnect board - when 
Moto switched to automated assembly the hand-installed wire jumpers 
were replaced with zero ohm resistors which could be inserted by the 
automated component insertion machines. &nbsp; These jumper replacements 
can be identified by a single black band in the middle of the resistor 
body.</td>
</tr></table><br>
</li>

<li>Another artifact to look for the two large tubular electrolytic 
capacitors on the left side of the interconnect board - the book 
says that they are 500uf in the Mitrek, and are 1,000uf in the Mitrek 
Plus - but I have found 1,000uf capacitors in the radios that don't 
have Y204... almost if the parts list used to stuff the interconnect 
boards during manufacture was updated and a large number of boards 
produced before Y204 was added to the main board. &nbsp; Note that 
you may have to remove the interconnect board from the radio to 
verify the value of the capacitors. &nbsp; If you can't, note the 
body length and lead bending angle. &nbsp; But realize that the 
larger caps only indicate a later production run of the interconnect 
board and in our use (repeater or link service) are totally irrelevant 
(they only affect the speaker audio).<br>

<p align="left"><b>The Bottom Line:</b> &nbsp; If you have a choice 
when you select a radio, pick a Plus radio by the chassis numbers 
that are on the 
<a href="mitrek-modnum.html">Mitrek 
Chassis and Model Numbers</a> 
web page, but if you don't have that list with you (I have it in 
my Palm Pilot) by all means pick the radios first with the the RCA 
connectors on the front end / exciter filter assembly. The second 
item to look for is the Y204 extra IF crystal filter - but if it's 
not there is can be added easily. &nbsp; Third, try and get at least one 
set of channel elements per radio - and really try and get the original 
elements with the radio - and then test it using a dummy load and a sig 
generator before you make <u>any</u> modifications. &nbsp; You don't 
want to convert a radio then find out it's dead, and you can't tell 
if the problem is in the original radio or the conversion. &nbsp; If 
you can't get the original elements, then get ones that you can recrystal 
to your needs. &nbsp; Make sure that the elements you do get are the 
proper ones... one of my 6 meter radios came with UHF elements in 
it - and the seller obviously knew they were the wrong ones because 
he had carefully removed the model number&nbsp;/&nbsp;frequency 
stickers from the elements).</p>

pins 6, 8, 9 and 10 and the other with them. &nbsp; Look for white, 
grey, blue and black wires (labeled on the control head end with the

Note: "X" in the jumper column above signifies that there is an unlabeled 
jumper on the early interconnect boards - if you want to use it you'll have

designators) have traces that can be cut to accomplish the same functionality.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p align="left">If you are going to use a Mitrek that does not have the 
chokes on the interconnect board in a repeater system consider replacing 
the jumpers with chokes in the leads that you use as interface connections 
to the outside world. &nbsp; Just take common carbon resistors and use them 
as coil forms, wrap them in 22,24 or 26 gauge enameled wire and solder the 
wire end to the resistor lead close to the resistor body. &nbsp; Stretching 
the wire slightly before you wind it helps it lie flat, and a drop of varnish, 
hot-melt glue, or even clear fingernail polish on the starting end helps hold 
it in place while you wind the rest of the coil, then another drop on the tail 
end holds it in place while you solder the end. &nbsp; Some clear heat-shrink 
tubing will finish the job. &nbsp; As long as the resistor value is over 
40-50 ohms the actual value doesn't matter as the choke will short it 
out. &nbsp; A free source of enameled wire is the deflection yoke or the 
high voltage transformer from a old TV set. &nbsp; Stretch it by clamping one 
end in a bench vise (or a fence post) and string off 6 to 10 feet and lean 
back with your whole body weight. &nbsp Then wind the choke with the stretched 
wire.</p>

<p align="left">If you decide to improve the RF filtering of a radio 
and you intend to do all of the mods listed here you will need to replace 
the jumpers with chokes at pin 7, 8, 9, 10, and 18. &nbsp; If you want 
to go overboard you can also add one more choke on pin 1 (which handles 
local microphone audio). &nbsp; The simplest way to add them is to cut 
the jumper on the connector side of the board, melt the solder and remove 
the two wire ends, suck the remaining solder out, and install the choke 
into the same holes but on the the side of the board facing inside the 
radio. &nbsp; Note that three of the jumpers (at JU6/L7, JU7/L8 and 
JU16/L19) are buried under a large coupling capacitor - you will need  
to lift one end of the cap to remove the jumpers.</p>

<p align="left">As long as you are inside the radio lift off the PA deck 
cover and do a visual check the tantalum electrolytic bypass capacitors 
on the positive 13.8 volt supply rails - and use a good magnifying 
glass. &nbsp; Replace any that look suspicious. &nbsp; The failure mode 
is that they go down in value or open up, and either can allow 
spurs... &nbsp; A second problem is that some radios didn't have enough 
driver stage bypassing. &nbsp; If you still have spurs (rare) add a large 
value cap on the driver stage +12v lead. &nbsp; Another Mitrek failure mode
is intermittent connections in the preselectors, and the Cactus writeup 
mentioned above has the cure for it, as well as WB4HFN's web page... see

<p align="left">Some folk run the hot side of the 7a fuse to pin 19... &nbsp; I 
don't like to do that because if the big fuse blows for some reason it 
will kill the RX as well. &nbsp; You can run the 7a fuse either to the 
positive 12v directly or through the big fuse, whatever works easier 
for you. &nbsp; In my case I was dedicating an Astron power supply to 
the dual link radio assembly plus I was using a control head so I added 
a large in-line fuseholder for the transmit pin 19 plus a small fuseholder 
for everything else. &nbsp; I put both of them in the cable harness that 
coupled both radios to the control head and the power supply. &nbsp; A 
diagram of the power wiring is later on in this writeup.</p>

<p align="left">The actual Monitor switch in the head is DPDT, and the 
second pole is used with other options like channel scan, 2-tone decode, 
or PAC-RT remote extender (mobile repeater).</p>

<p align="left">Capacitors C1, C2 and C3 are located on the interconnect 
board. &nbsp; C1 and C2 are 500uf in the Mitrek, 1,000uf in the Mitrek 
Plus. &nbsp; C3 is either 4.7uf or 10uf depending on the vintage of the 
radio. &nbsp; If you find a 4.7uf cap in your radio as C3 I suggest you 
change it (or just parallel another one across it) as the higher value 
improves the RX audio.</p>

<p align="left">The lead for pin 16 is not required in 99% of the amateur 
applications - most repeater controllers use separate carrier and PL 
decode lines rather than one line and a carrier squelch&nbsp;/&nbsp;PL 
select line. &nbsp; Most radios in amateur radio repeater service usually 
sit in carrier squelch mode forever, and the repeater controller does all 
the work in selecting PL or Carrier squelch mode by selecting either 
the carrier squelch or PL decode line, or ANDing them together. &nbsp; If 
you end up needing an extra wire in the control connector you can cut the 
JU14&nbsp;/&nbsp;L16 jumper (disabling the carrier&nbsp;/&nbsp;PL 
switch on the control head) and solder to the pad on the interconnect 
board that connects to pin 16. &nbsp; Then tie into pin 16 by the head.</p>

<p align="left">You could mount the volume and squelch pots inside the 
radio and tie them to the radio side of JU10&nbsp;/&nbsp;L11, 
JU12&nbsp;/&nbsp;L14, JU13&nbsp;/&nbsp;L15 and 
to ground, but it's a bit cramped inside. &nbsp; Doing so, however would 
free up pins 14 and 15 which could be used for other things, at the possible 
expense of not being able to bench test the radio with a standard cable and 
head. &nbsp; If you are going to mount the volume and squelch controls any 
distance from the radio remember that Moto uses a braided shield around 
the conductors connected to pins 11, 14 and 15 on the control cable 
connector, with the shield hooked to pin 2 on the radio end (audio ground) 
and pin 21 on the control head end.</p>

<p align="left">The Mitrek volume and squelch pots are 25k ohms which 
is not a common value in the electronic component world (especially in 
the surplus world) - the common ones are 10K and 50K. &nbsp; The Mitrek 
"clamshell" control head uses PC board mount pots with shafts and knobs, 
and the "ACM" - short for "Alternate Control Module" - head uses PC board 
mount thumbwheel pots. &nbsp; If you are going to mount the controls on 
a rack panel you need to locate an old Motrac, Motran or Mocom-70 mobile 
control head to scavenge the regular panel-mount pots from. &nbsp; DO NOT 
try to use the earlier radio's head directly on the Mitrek without modification 
as the older radios used a speaker connection that had one side grounded, 
where the Mitrek uses both sides of the speaker hot (the mod is a simple 
one). &nbsp; If your old head came with the palm microphone you can 
scavenge it and the mic jack and use it on the rack panel as well.</p>

<p align="left">In the rest of this writeup I am going to assume 
that you are either modifying a Mitrek Plus radio (with the factory 
inductors on the interconnect board) or you have replaced the above 
mentioned JU6&nbsp;/&nbsp;L7, JU7&nbsp;/&nbsp;L8, JU8&nbsp;/&nbsp;L9, 
JU9&nbsp;/&nbsp;L10, JU15&nbsp;/&nbsp;L18 and maybe JU5&nbsp;/&nbsp;L1 
jumpers with homebrew inductors... in other words from here on I'm 
going to use L-designators when referring to the interconnect board 
jumper&nbsp;/&nbsp;inductor positions as the later boards are silk-screened 
that way. &nbsp; I'm also going to assume that you have a factory 
PL board in the radio. &nbsp; Frankly, a used HLN-4181 is much cheaper 
than a TS-64 and besides it was made for the job. &nbsp; If you don't 
have one, either buy one from a used equipment vendor like Telepath 
or C. W. Wolfe or dig a Com-Spec TS-32 or a TS-64 out of the junk 
box... <a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/mitrek/com-spec-ts-64-to-mitrek.pdf">here's the Com-Spec 
TS-64 instructions for the Mitrek</a>. &nbsp; I have another web 
page at www.repeater-builder.com that shows how to make your own 
PL elements for the HLN-4181.</p>

<p>Don't forget to jumper the F1 channel elements to ground or you 
will have a very dead receiver. &nbsp; The easiest way to do this is 
to remove (if present) JU601, 602, 604, 605, 606, 607, 609 and 610 
and insert JU611 (it's near the RX channel elements). &nbsp; Note 
that this grounds the F1 lead on the front panel connector (pin 7) that 
we will be using for something else in the next step, but we can fix 
that very easily.</p>

<A NAME="PL_encode">
<p align="left"><font size=+2><b>PL Encoder control</b></font><br>
This mod works on both the reedless and the reed board. &nbsp; Lift 
the radio side of L6 on the interconnect board. &nbsp; The radio 
side is grounded by JU611 so lifting it is necessary. &nbsp; This 
disconnects the main board which disconnects the aforementioned 
C602 0.01uf capacitor. &nbsp; Install a 12v reed relay with the 
contacts across JU2 of the HLN-4181 or JU3 of the HLN-4020 PL 
board, and the coil hooked between +12 and the now-floating 
JU6/L7 end. &nbsp; Ground pin 7, the F1 pin, to close the 
relay. &nbsp; Select the normally open or normally closed contacts 
depending on what the normal state of your encoder will be...
 &nbsp; On both of the PL boards shorting the jumper kills the 
encoder tone, and in my case I used the normally open contacts since 
I wanted the relay's idle state to be the PL encoder on. &nbsp; I did 
not use an open collector transistor instead of the relay contacts for 
this because using a reed relay was easier, faster, simpler, provided 
an absolute zero-ohm ground (the less resistance you have, the better 
the tone cutoff) and in my case the encoder off fuction is only used 
for a few hours once or twice a year (so I definitely wasn't going to 
wear out the relay). &nbsp; I was also doing this conversion on a 
deadline. &nbsp; Note that if your controller does not have a back-EMF 
snubbing diode on the digital output make sure you add one.<br>
If I was going to do it all over again, I'd use a FET instead of the 
reed relay and that would allow me to key the PL encoder with the main 
channel RX COS signal. &nbsp; You'd need a FET with low "on" resistance, 
and the source and drain leads would go in place of JU2, with the gate 
lead through a resistor to the F1 pin. &nbsp; Or I might use an 
opto-isolator between the F1 pin and the FET.</p>

<p align="left">In perusing the schematic of the HLN-4020 reed board I 
did notice one nice feature: it can be jumpered to use one reed for common 
encode/decode or two reeds for split tones. &nbsp; I've not seen that feature 
in any other reed-based PL board. &nbsp; When two reeds are used the encode 
reed is on the left of the hold-down bracket in the above picture with the 
decode reed on the right, when one reed is used it goes in the encoder socket 
and two jumpers are added. &nbsp; The necessary jumpers are documented in the 
later schematics of the board (they are not included in the board revision D 
schematic but they are there are on the revision F schematic). &nbsp; An early 
board can be jumpered for a single reed using the info from the later schmatic.</p>

<p align="left">The rest of this section is focused on the HLN-4181 
"reedless" PL board since I had six radios with five HLN-4181s, and 
only one of the HLN-4020 reed board. &nbsp; Working for NASA for 6 
years taught me that you don't put equipment into mission-critical 
service (i.e. on a mountaintop) that you do not have known good and 
ready-to-go spares for on the shelf. &nbsp; In my opinion service trips 
should be limited to swapping entire units out, not fixing them on site 
(unless thatis the absolute last resort). &nbsp; Especially if it takes 
you a couple of hours to get to the start of the dirt road, and another 
hour in 4-wheel-drive to get up to the radio site... and that's in good 
weather.</p>

HLN-4181 reedless board and the tricks they can do, plus information on how

ways...  The normal configuration of jumpers (and the most useful one) 
is listed in the table below... The board can run simultaneous encode 
and decode - the encode portion generates the PL tone continuously 
while the other half is able to decode PL at the same time.</p>

<p align="left">A PL decode signal is available at the collector of Q1 
of the HLN-4181 PL board, which is available at one end of the JU6 
jumper. &nbsp; This transistor takes the PL decode signal from the 
custom chip and inverts it before sending it to the audio mute transistor 
(located on the main board). &nbsp; I used a length of insulated wire 
to run that signal over to the end of the JU1 jumper that feeds pin 1 of 
the 9-pin connector that connects the PL board to the interconnect board 
of the Mitrek. &nbsp; The connections are pretty obvious when examining the 
schematic, and are easily traceable when looking at the actual circuit 
board.</p>

  <td valign=top>Above is a picture of JU3A and how the designer at Moto expected 
you to jumper it. &nbsp; It's a cute, inventive and resourceful idea but those 
1/4 inch tab connectors fall off in mobile service, even if you squeeze them very 
tightly and push them on.</td>
  <td valign=top>Personally, I bend up a piece of bare copper wire into a 
hairpin and solder one end to one side of the board and the other end to the 
other side. &nbsp; I leave an air gap under each loop so I can clip an 
EZ-Hook&#153;-style test lead to it. &nbsp; I install a wire on the left side 
simply as a handy ground point (one side of JU3C is ground) for a VOM or 
an oscilloscope probe (as shown), the right side wire in this picture is 
the actual JU3A PL decode jumper.</td></tr>

<p align="left">Note that this voltage from the collector of Q1 is not a true 
logic level - it will drive the PL decode input of most repeater controllers 
just fine, but if you need a signal that goes all the way to ground - for 
example to drive a LED (perhaps in a control head) you'll need to add a driver 
transistor. &nbsp; The version below provides an open collector output for 
the PL decode signal. &nbsp; If the upper transistor has enough gain the 
lower transistor may not be needed (see above for the rest of the details).</p>

<p align="left">If I were to do this over today I'd use the circuit 
above - I'd use the existing transistor on the PL board to drive 
the LED side of an open-collector optoisolator (effectively 
shunting the 94k resistor to the point that it pretty-much 
drops out of the circuit). &nbsp; The resistor in series with 
the LED side (the one shown without a value) would have to be 
selected to pass enough current to turn on the opto-isolator's 
LED fully without going into overcurrent (check the spec sheet 
for the optoisolators LED). &nbsp; The use of the optoisolator 
makes this circuit pretty universal.</p>

<p align="left"><font size=+2><b>Using a separate PL encoder with the 
HLN-4181</b></font><br>
The design of the reedless board uses the encoder as the frequency 
reference for the decoder function, and as such it can't run split 
tones (i.e. different encode and decode tones). &nbsp; If you need 
to run simultaneous split tones in a single duplexed radio you will 
have to add a second device, either a PL encoder or decoder. &nbsp; Having 
done both, I can tell you that it's much easier to add an encoder. &nbsp; I've 
used home-brew twin-T oscillators, Cetec-Vega 188's, Com-Spec SS-32s, TS-32s, 
SS-64s, and TS-64s (the SS-nn is the encode-only version of the equivalent 
TS-nn product). &nbsp; The TS-32 series does not have reverse-burst (unless 
you use an RB-1), the TS-64 does. &nbsp; There is more information on the

<p align="left">Note that JU3A is on the interconnect board and 
JU3 is on the PL board. &nbsp; JU7 is normally used with external 
PL encoders built into the control head - these feed the PL tone 
in via control connector pin 18 and JU3A and JU7 must not be in 
place in a duplexed radio if you are routing the PL decode signal 
out via Control connector pin 18 and JU1.</p>

<p align="left">Before connecting the new encoder leave JU3 on the PL board 
in place and make sure JU7 is out. &nbsp; Then key the TX and measure the 
existing encoder's audio level (AC voltage) at test point E1 and write it 
down. &nbsp; Now remove JU3 and connect the new encoder's audio output 
to the R27 side of JU7. &nbsp; Ground can be acquired from one side of R2 
nearby, from one side of JU2, from test point E3 or from pin 9 of P3 
(the 9-pin connector to the interconnect board). &nbsp; Depending on what 
DC supply voltage your new encoder requires you can find filtered +12v on 
the wide trace that connects L3, C43 and R45, or you can get regulated 
+9.1v from the trace that ties pins 31 and 6 of the 40-pin chip together, 
or from the solder pad shown in the photo below. &nbsp; With the AC voltmeter 
back on E1 you can now set the level of the replacement encoder to match the 
original AC voltage. &nbsp; If you are running separate TX and RX radios you 
can also locate the external encoder outside the radio and use the interconnect 
board JU3 and PL board JU1 and JU6 and JU7 jumpers in the TX radio like they 
were intended...  &nbsp; Note that the above implementation will not have 
reverse burst, as that is generated inside the HLN-4181 board's custom 
chip. &nbsp; If you need reverse burst you can use the external PL encoder 
that was designed for the Mitrek or Micor "System's 90" control head setup, 
or a Communications Specialists TS-64. &nbsp; Here's 
<a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/mitrek/com-spec-ts-64-to-mitrek.pdf">Com-Spec's own writeup on the TS-64 
for the Mitrek</a>. &nbsp; It's not oriented to using it as an encoder-only, 
but the encoder and reverse-burst hookup is quite relevant.</p>

Bringing TX audio (i.e. repeat audio) in from the outside world into 
the radio is simple because the Mitrek is a true FM radio and the 
actual modulation is done inside the channel element. &nbsp; All we 
have to do is to tap and insert audio into the modulation line going 
to the element. &nbsp; There is an easy way and a right way... Both 
take a 10uf audio coupling capacitor and connect it from the control 
connector's frequency 4 select pin through the RF protection choke 
to the modulation line of the transmitter channel elements. &nbsp; The 
difference is where we tap into that modulation line.</p>

pre-emphasis you need to do it to the audio before it hits the

<p align="left">
In my case when the radio's dev pot is set properly and the repeat 
TX audio level out of the controller is adjusted properly the local 
mic audio is a little low - however if the local person "close talks" 
the microphone (with the lips just barely clearing the mic grille) 
and speaks at a level just a little above normal conversation level 
it is perfectly acceptable for test use. &nbsp; As often as I go to 
a hilltop site and need to use the link radio's local microphone I 
can live with having to close-talk and "speak up" a little.</p>

<p align="left">It is the authors opinion that having the repeat 
audio level be independent of the RX volume control, plus having 
a working local speaker and permanently installed local microphone 
jack on every radio in the system is very useful - it allows a local 
user to simply walk up to the rack, turn up the volume on any 
radio and monitor the frequency. &nbsp; If needed he can pick up 
the appropriate microphone (or plug in a microphone) and talk just 
as he would expect to.</p>

<p align="left">
Yes, the second transistor inverts the first and is not really 
needed, but I prefer open collector outputs from radios, and I 
prefer active-low signals between the radios and any external 
circuitry, especially repeater controllers. &nbsp; Why? well, 
I prefer open collectors since most controllers have their own 
internal pull-up resistors, and a open collector output is 
therefore universal - it will work with a +5v logic system, a +12v 
logic system, relays, a LED (for testing), anything, and all with 
no modifications. &nbsp; I prefer active low signals becasue if 
a radio loses power or otherwise fails, the controller doesn't 
"pull up" the dead signal to a false positive, resulting in the 
system being keyed until the timeout timer disables the system 
TX (you DO have a separate backup timeout timer, don't you?), 
thereby rendering the entire system unusable. &nbsp; Also when 
you are working on the system you can do a large amount of testing 
with nothing more than a clip lead shorting the open collector 
outputs to ground without worrying that you're going to blow 
something up (picture a site visit some day... PL decode not 
working? gound the PL decode lead and see if the PL indicator 
on the controller front panel lights up. &nbsp; yes? the problem's 
gotta be inside the receiver chassis!). &nbsp; Also with open 
collector interfacing you can shut off the system, disconnect or 
un-cable the bad radio/device/etc. and then turn the power back 
on and everything else in the system still works because the 
unplugged open circuit looks like the idle open collector...</p>

just leave off the second transistor and use this:

<b>Note that the above COS circuit is in reality an open squelch 
detector and only works as a COS if you leave the radio's squelch 
circuit in carrier squelch mode.</b> &nbsp; We are deriving our 
COS signal from the audio mute transistor and for it to be valid we have 
to leave the RX in carrier squelch mode. &nbsp; The PL board mod above 
brings the PL decode indicator to the outside world, but leaves it hooked 
to the main board audio mute circuit (I wanted to avoid as many radio mods 
as possible - to make the radio as "serviceable&nbsp;/&nbsp;testable" on a 
standard-wired test bench as possible). &nbsp; This means that if you place 
the receiver into PL mode the audio mute transistor will be controlled by 
the combined COS and the PL decode signals (remember the "AND" and "OR" 
jumpers on the PL board?), which we don't want. &nbsp; It is very desirable 
to be able to deliver separate COS and PL decode lines to your repeater 
controller, and depending on the capabilities of your controller you can 
run the system in carrier only mode, PL only mode, carrier AND PL mode, 
or in Carrier OR PL mode. &nbsp; As a bonus some controllers (one is the 
Scom 7K) allow you to run the repeater in carrier mode while requiring 
all commands (touchtone) to have a PL tone - and if you want, you can 
have a command or two that doesn't require PL...</p>

<p align="left">So leaving your Mitrek local speaker in carrier mode is a 
"So what?" type of a problem... &nbsp; You are going to leave the radio 
volume control turned down to zero, and at a mountaintop repeater site 
nobody will be there to hear it anyway. &nbsp; Forcing the receiver into 
permanent carrier squelch mode is easily done in several ways:

<ul compact>
<li>leave the control head "Monitor" switch (a push-in / push-out button) 
in carrier mode</li>

<li>unplug control cable lead #16 from the back of the control head and 
tape it off (this disables the monitor switch)</li>

<li>leave pin 16 on the RX control connector floating (i.e. don't solder a 
wire to it when you build your custom control cable). &nbsp; Or leave the 
pin open AND put a short length of heat shrink on it (a trick I learned at 
NASA&nbsp;/&nbsp;JPL in the 1970s - it tells you and the next guy to check 
the documentation, i.e. "No, I didn't forget this pin, it's not connected 
for a reason!").</li>

<li>cut JU14&nbsp;/&nbsp;L16 on the interconnect board. &nbsp; No matter WHAT 
you do to pin 16 on the outside of the radio, it's going to stay in carrier 
squelch mode.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">Personally, I do not like option 1 - it's not idiot proof from 
someone opening the rack and accidentally bumping a switch while doing something 
else. &nbsp; I've used option 2 when I'm using stock cables, or option 3 when I'm 
building custom cables. &nbsp; I leave JU14&nbsp;/&nbsp;L16 alone so that the 
radio still works properly on the test bench.</p>

<p align="left">If you use the RLC-MOT board to create your repeat audio out 
the discusion above is irrelevant as the Mitrek stock carrier squelch and RX 
audio circuits are completely bypassed.</p>

<p align="left"><font size=+2><b>Alternative Carrier Operated Relay circuits 
and points</b></font><br>
Quite a few of the other Mitrek modification web pages tell you to use test 
point 'E' in the radio, or to take a COS signal from U401, pin&nbsp;4, or 
from the PL board.<br>
I'll describe those here...

<ul compact>
<li>Point 'E' is a test point on the RX schematic and is the collector 
of Q406 (I used the emitter of the same transistor). &nbsp; Physically 
it can be found near the pin 8 corner of U403, between CR404 and 
L401. &nbsp; Motorola uses this 
point in their consolette (tabletop base station) carrier indicator 
option board. &nbsp; Point 'E' sits at about +2.8 volts when squelched 
and drops to about +0.1 to 0.2v with the squelch open. &nbsp; One reason 
that this point is so attractive is that it's the "official Motorola" way 
to do it, especially when turning a consolette Mitrek into a tabletop 
repeater. &nbsp; When I tried using it, however, the carrier squelch 
action changed with the circuit connected and reverted back to normal 
with it removed. &nbsp; I didn't like that "feature" - the squelch 
action should be consistent with or without the open collector transistor 
driver connected. &nbsp; Maybe I screwed up in the breadboarding, (I probably 
did), I don't know.</li><br>
<br>
<li>You can also take COS from U401, pin 4. &nbsp; This point is low 
with the squelch closed, rising to about +6 volts when the squelch 
opens. &nbsp; This spot is nice because it is very simple to get to: it's 
one of the speaker leads, right off of the speaker driver IC, however as a 
COS output it fails if you turn up the volume... the speaker audio rides 
on top of the DC voltage and the low going half of the audio sinewave can 
dip below the COS threshold causing the COS function to get very ragged 
and very unusable very quickly...</li><br>
<br>
<li>You can also take COS from pin 5 (the audio mute signal) on the 
PL board connector (this is accessible at a jumper, and the jumper number 
varies with which PL board you have, so check the schematic of your PL 
or DPL board). &nbsp; Since this is not a true COS, but just the audio 
mute signal, this again only works if you leave the radio in carrier 
squelch. &nbsp; The COS voltage will swing from about 1.5 volts (with 
the squelch open) to somewhere between 6v and 12v with the squelch 
closed (the value depends on which of the three Moto PL / DPL boards 
you have installed, if any). &nbsp; This is a high impedance signal, 
so you can't put too much load on it or you will start to affect the 
squelch action.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">All in all, if you are going to use the internal carrier 
squelch simply taking the DC voltage off the emitter lead of Q406 with a 
transistor inverter works the best for me. &nbsp; It's simple, reliable, 
is guaranteed to work with any of the three PL&nbsp;/&nbsp;DPL boards, 
and the rest of the radio has no idea it's there.</p>

<p align="left">After this web page went up I received an email from a 
friend that basically stated "Point 'E' works just fine for me. &nbsp; Just 
connect a 15k ohm resistor to point E and use it like this:" &nbsp; (his 
schematic below, you can add the extra transistor as above to generate a 
low going output signal):

<A NAME="Audio_Out">
<p align="left"><font size=+2><b>Repeat Audio Out</b></font><br>
I do NOT like methods that take audio out of the repeater receiver in 
such a way that the repeat audio level varies as the receiver's local 
volume control is adjusted. &nbsp; It is my personal opinion that the 
repeater receiver volume control should be used for the local speaker 
volume, period. &nbsp; This rule adds one more level of "idiot-proofness". &nbsp; The 
method described below does just that.</p>

<p align="left">Repeat audio out is actually pretty easy - just use a 
Link-Comm RLC-MOT board (described in the squelch&nbsp;/&nbsp;COS section). &nbsp; But 
if you decide to "roll your own", it is a simple process as long as 
your repeater controller can mute the receive audio. &nbsp; Just 
add a 10uf cap inside the radio between the discriminator to pin 9 
of the control connector. &nbsp; Note: do not use a tantalum cap here, 
they are bad news when used as audio coupling capacitors. &nbsp; If 
your controller does <u>not</u> do the audio muting for you, like 
the ACC RC-85 and RC-96 models, you will have to add a series FET 
audio switch controlled by the COS, or use Link's RLC-MOT (which 
has it's own audio muting).</p>

<p align="left">On the other hand, in the diagram above the audio to 
the controller <u>IS</u> de-emphasized. &nbsp; The overall audio level 
will also be lower than without the de-emphasis circuitry. &nbsp; For 
more information on the "magic values" in the schematic above and how 
to calculate them, see the excellent article by Matt Lechliter W6KGB 
at <a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/rbtip/pdemph.html">
http://www.repeater-builder.com/rbtip/pdemph.html</a>. &nbsp; In the
above diagram the repeater controller must have an input impedance
greater than 150k (calculated as 10x the 15K resistor above). &nbsp; 
High impedance inputs can be RF sensitive, make sure you use shielded
audio cable for this connection - I use RG-174 as audio cabling in my 
repeaters. &nbsp; It's regular 50 ohm coax, and while it is lossy at 
VHF and UHF frequencies it's perfectly OK at audio.  Besides it's not 
expensive, it's readily available, small, has a tight shield and is 
very flexible.</p>

<p align="left">Note that the Mitrek has a PL filter on the PL decoder 
board, unfortunately it is positioned in the RX audio stream after the 
volume control and it is a notch-type filter. &nbsp; Ideally it would 
be a high-pass filter located before the volume control so that the 
repeat audio would have the PL filtered out, but it's not. &nbsp; Several 
folks have tried to use the internal filter in repeat or link service, and 
the performance leaves a LOT to be desired. &nbsp; The overall consensus 
is that it's not worth even trying. &nbsp; Some folk disable the on-board 
PL filter to eliminate any modification of the received audio - just remove 
C38 on the PL board (if you are careful as you remove it you can reuse it 
in the audio de-emphasis circuit above). &nbsp; If you need a high-pass 
PL filter it's easy to add an outboard PL filter between the Mitrek RX 
and the controller. &nbsp; An excellent one can be found at <a href="http://www.ka9fur.net/w9hhx-io-pg4.jpg">http://www.ka9fur.net/w9hhx-io-pg4.jpg</a>. &nbsp; Leave out the ID notch filter unless you need it. &nbsp; There are two more at 
<a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/pl-filter">http://www.repeater-builder.com/pl-filter</a>. &nbsp; If 
you want to you can place the filter in the audio line in place of JU10&nbsp;/&nbsp;L11 
on the interconnect board, or externally between the radio and the repeater 
controller. &nbsp; If you place the PL filter at the JU10&nbsp;/&nbsp;L11 point 
you will want to relocate the repeat audio output pickoff point to after 
the filter.</p>

<A NAME="Carrier_Squelch">
<p align="left"><font size=+2><b>Comments on the Mitrek Carrier Squelch</b></font><br>
Modern FM radios utilize a noise operated squelch which works by 
measuring the amplitude of the discriminator white noise at the 
audio frequelcies above the frequency range used by the human 
voice. &nbsp; Speech lives in the range from 300hz to a certain point, 
above that is all noise. &nbsp; The cutoff frequency between what is 
considered voice and what is considered squelch noise is critical: too 
low and the squelch will chop on higher pitched voices, too high and 
there won't be enough high frequency noise to work with (the top 
frequency of the available noise is controlled by the IF bandwidth).</p>

<p align="left">Imagine a RF generator connected to the RX, the 
squelch is wide open, and an AC voltmeter connected to an audio dummy 
load hooked across the the speaker leads is showing a volt or two of 
noise.  &nbsp; As you slowly increase the level of an on-channel dead 
carrier, the level of squelch noise quickly lowers with just a little 
bit of signal. &nbsp; If you reduce the carrier level the noise comes 
back up. &nbsp; Receiver sensitivity is measured this way, look for the 
"20db quieting" measurment in a radio specification sheet (and some 
point-to-point links - especially voting RX links - need 30, 35 or even 
40db of quieting). &nbsp; The noise operated squelch circuit takes this 
high frequency AC noise and amplifies it and rectifies it into a DC 
voltage that varies with the noise level. &nbsp; When this DC voltage 
drops below a specific threshold (set by the squelch control) the speaker 
unmutes, and as it rises above the threshold the speaker mutes. &nbsp; Most 
modern radios use two different thresholds (the difference is called the 
<i>squelch hysteresis</i> amount), one level for squelch open, and a 
slightly lower one for squelch close. &nbsp; This improves how the user 
preceives the squelch action: once the squelch opens the signal can drop 
back past the squelch-open threshold level and then drop a a little more 
before it closes.</p>

<p align="left">Many people are dissatisfied with the stock Mitrek 
squelch, especially if thy have ever been exposed to a Micor or a GE 
Mastr-II. &nbsp; The typical complaint is that that the squelch threshold 
level (to stop the white noise in the speaker) is much lower than the 
level required to eliminate the random "cracklies" caused by on-channel 
noise spikes. &nbsp; In other words to get a totally quiet receiver the 
Mitrek squelch control has to be set much higher than the initial 
squelch-closing threshold - in some cases turning the squelch control 
all the way to the top isn't enough.</p>

<p align="left">The reason for the poor performance of the Mitrek 
carrier squelch circuit is inherent in it's overall design. &nbsp; The 
entire circuit uses only only five transistors. &nbsp; The Mitrek came into 
being in a era where the use of PL or DPL was universal, and carrier squelch had 
gone by the wayside. &nbsp; Motorola installed a simple noise operated squelch, and 
it almost seems to have been included as an after thought. &nbsp; The designer didn't 
put much time or thought into it, knowing that it wouldn't be used 
much... </p>

<p align="left">In contrast, Motorola put a great deal of effort 
into the Micor's noise squelch circuit since the use of PL and DPL 
had not become universal at the time of the Micor's design. &nbsp; In 
short, the Micor was the high water mark for carrier squelch circuit 
development - the heart of the Micor carrier squelch circuit is a single 
custom IC chip which contains over a hundred transistors. &nbsp; Unfortunately 
this part is obtainable only as a spare part from Motorola or by 
carefully scavenging it off of a Micor audio-squelch board (and it 
was not socketed). &nbsp; The Micor squelch chip is a complete bi-level 
or switched hysteresis squelch system on a single chip. &nbsp; Simply, 
the Micor bi-level squelch works better than anything else on the 
air. &nbsp; Note that the circuit could be added to any model radio - even 
the Metrum-II. &nbsp; In fact, it's not hard to hook an inexpensive Micor 
mobile Audio-Squelch card (available for $5 or so) to almost any radio that 
has raw discriminator audio and positive 9.6v DC voltage available. &nbsp; A 
25k squelch pot completes the circuit.</p>

<p align="left">Naturally, when a need shows up, somebody fills it for a 
price. &nbsp; Link-Comm makes a line of repeater controllers and they have 
an accessory board called the "RLC-MOT" that will add a Micor squelch into 
any receiver that provides raw discriminator audio. &nbsp; The board will 
fit inside <u>any</u> mobile radio and is much smaller than the actual 
Micor audio-squelch board, works great and makes the squelch action a lot 
more pleasing, and eliminating the squelch tail the stock Mitrek creates.</p>

<p align="left">The RLC-MOT uses a trimpot for an on-board squelch control 
(a 20 turn!), has a LED that lights when the squelch is open, and and has 
an audio level pot on board.</p>

<p align="left">If you are using an RLC-MOT module and need a de-emphasized 
repeat audio output you can take advantage of the fact that the option of 
de-emphasizing the audio was designed into it from the start - just add 
a capacitor across R9 on the module itself. &nbsp;  There are solder pads 
for it already in place (labeled C18). &nbsp; They are small and you will 
have to use a very small cap and a very small soldering iron, and work quickly 
and carefully but they are there. &nbsp; Depending upon the audio response 
you'd like to see, the cap should be somewhere between .0075uf (breakpoint 
at about 200hz) to .022uf (breakpoint at about 75hz). &nbsp; While you can 
tailor it to suit your desires of low-frequency response the lower you go in 
frequency the less "effective gain" you will achieve due to the modification 
of the buffer/amp circuit's frequency response. A 0.01 cap will give you a 
breakpoint of 150hz,which is likely the best compromise. &nbsp; The 
RLC-MOT is available from <a href="http://www.link-comm.com">Link Comm</a> 
at 800-610-4085 for about US$60. &nbsp; Yes, I know, you spent less on the 
entire radio.</p>

<p align="left">Audio to feed the RLC-Mot can be derived from two 
places: purists can take if from pin 1 of U403A in the receiver, bypassing 
the main-board-to-interconnect-board junction (suggested) or from the radio 
side of JU10/L11 (which feeds pin 11 of the control connector).</p>

<p align="left">When you mount the RLC-MOT make sure you do it so that the 
on-board LED is visible. &nbsp; Double-sided foam tape works fine. You will 
need to get to the squelch adjust pot (labeled R3), the audio level pot 
(R14) and to see the squelch LED (D1).</p>

<p><b>Here's the right way to do it</b>:<br>
I really suggest that you use the "High COS Out" signal to drive an open 
collector transistor as shown below, with the collector going to the outside 
world via JU7/L8/pin 8. &nbsp; Doing this will protect the RLC-MOT module 
from any errors in hookup outside the radio - I'd much rather toast a 25 
cent transistor than a $60 module... the transistor takes the heat, so 
to speak. &nbsp; If I were to do it over today I'd use the RLC-MOT to 
drive an open collector opto-isolator instead of the open collector 
transistor.</p>

<A NAME="Duplexing">
<p align="left"><font size=+2><b>Duplexing / Dual Radios / Interconnections</b></font><br>
Duplexing a UHF Mitrek can be tricky, and in many cases is frequency dependent 
(i.e. it will work on some frequencies and not on others). &nbsp; <u>The 
406-420mhz models will spur if duplexed</u> (please read the entire Cactus 
Radio document mentioned at the top of this writeup) and since I had two 
Mitreks and four Mitrek Plus radios on hand for the project I elected to 
just use two of the Plus radios for my full duplex point-to-point link. &nbsp; Using 
two radios also meant that I didn't have to do the standard "duplex mod" (see 
below). &nbsp; As my long-term plans were to replace the two 440mhz Mitreks 
with 420mhz ones, I had to use two radios anyway.</p>

<p align="left">One additional mod I made to the control head that 
when first described makes people wonder why: <u>I shorted out the 
double pole power switch on the control head volume control</u> with
two individual jumpers and added a label to the front of the control 
head that says "Control head power switch bypassed - Use power switch 
on Astron to turn link radios on and off".  &nbsp; Why? &nbsp; I made 
the change and added the label after I turned the volume down a little 
too far as I was leaving the site on Sunday night and killed the 
link... it was dead for a week until I could get back to the site and 
turn the switch back on. &nbsp; It was very frustrating - a one and 
one/half hour drive just to get to the start of the 4-wheel-drive 
dirt road, then another hour to get to the radio site. &nbsp; Out of 
the vehicle for long enough to open the building door, disable the 
alarm, flip a switch, test the link, re-enable the alarm, lock the 
door, then 2 and 1/2 more hours to get back home. &nbsp; On my next 
visit I jumpered the switch out and added the label.... adding one 
more layer of "idiot-proofness". &nbsp; Phil Lefever, KB&Oslash;NES 
made the point quite well in an email when he said: "I hate driving 
up the hill to fix something I could have done better the first time 
around".</p>

<p align="left">Here's a crude diagram of my dual radio cabling - it 
makes two Mitreks look like one single full duplex radio:

<p align="left">To connect the two radios to a single control head I 
took two old Motrac cables (Mitrek, Motrac, Mocom 70 and some of the 
earlier all-tube vintage radios all used the same connector but with 
different wiring). &nbsp; The control harness in the drawing above was 
built up by starting with a control cable that had been cut during 
removal (C. W. Wolfe sells these for a very reasonable price). &nbsp; I 
took the control head end with the numbered pin connectors which gave me 
some nice long leads and then scavenged the radio end connectors off of 
both cables. &nbsp;  This gave me two connectors, two sets of connector 
shells and a full set of pinned and numbered leads about 5 feet long.</p>

<p align="left">The leads to the radio connectors were cut to length as I 
added each wire to the harness. &nbsp; I wired everything up using the 
recycled numbered leads so I had a RX radio and a TX radio on one single 
frequency control head (i.e. no frequency switch)... see the detailed 
diagram below.</p>

<p align="left">To connect the dual radio assembly to the repeater controller 
I cut a slot in the back of the control head to allow a piece of 15-conductor 
flat ribbon cable to exit out of the head. &nbsp; The actual DB15 connector 
and ribbon cable I used came off of a game port connector plate from an old 
combination I/O card from an ISA vintage PC. &nbsp; I cut off the 16-pin 
header connector and separated the individual leads for a few inches and 
stripped the insulation off. &nbsp; To get the ribbon cable out of the head 
I drilled two holes with a 1/8" drill bit just far apart to clear the cable 
and used an old soldering iron with a long thin concial tip that just fit 
into the 1/8"hole and dragged it sideways to melt the plastic between the 
two holes. &nbsp; Moto used good thick plastic, it took a while to do 
it and do it with good ventillation. &nbsp; I don't have access to a milling 
machine but if you do then you could duplicate that slot much faster or even 
mount a DB-15F into the top or front of the head itself... above the area 
where the frequency switch would go is one good place....</p>

<p align="left">The overall radio-control head harness consisted of all 
the pinned cable leads that were required plus the two large power cables, 
all tied together with a piece of 3/8 or 1/2" (I forget which) spiral wrap 
(from the local auto parts store) that started with the power wiring and 
the TX connector on one end, the RX connector in the middle, and the control 
head and controller DB15 connector at the other. If you are not using a 
control head then you could mount a pair of miniature volume and squelch 
pots and a couple of LEDs in the connector shell itself.</p>

Notes:<ol> <!-- don't move the paragraphs or the numbering changes -->
<li>&nbsp;TX pin 1 and 2 is a shielded cable with the shield connected to pin 2. &nbsp; Pin 1 is mic audio, 2 is audio ground.</li>

<li>&nbsp;TX pins 3 and 5 have a 47 ohm 1 to 2 watt load resistor connected to them
    (a dummy speaker load).</li>

<li>&nbsp;RX pins 11, 14 and 15 are shielded with the shield hooked to pin 2 on 
    the radio end and pin 21 on the control head end (audio ground).</li>

<li>&nbsp;RX pin 16 normally connected to control head pin 16 to allow the control
    head "Monitor" switch to set the RX into PL or carrier mode. By leaving the 
    pin 16 unhooked the PL decoder can never accidentally be enabled.<br>
    I personally do not solder a wire to the pin and in fact put a piece of 
    heatshrink over the RX connector pin 16. &nbsp; This heat shrink on the bare 
    pin is a memory-jog trick I learned at NASA in the 1970s - it tells you (and 
    the next guy) to check the documentation before doing anything with that 
    connector pin.</li>

<li>&nbsp;These two resistors are optional... You could put them on the back of 
    the TX connector from pins 19 to 17 and connect the center point to a lead 
    plugged into pin 22 of the control head and from there to a DB15 pin tied 
    to a spare digital input on the controller. &nbsp; Pin 22 of the control 
    head is normally hooked to pin 6 of the PL switch (the one labeled "Monitor") 
    and you can cut the trace behind the switch and use the adjacent plated-through 
    hole to connect the DB15 cable lead. &nbsp; The two resistors divide the power 
    supply voltage to a logic high, i.e. about 4.5 to 5v. If the big fuse blows 
    the controller digital input will go low and the controller can announce "No 
    power to link radio TX" when you switch on the link... &nbsp; (if you have a leftover 
    digital input, you might as well use it for something interesting until you need 
    it for something useful).</li>

<li>&nbsp;If you have a second spare digital input just duplicate the two resistors 
    but put them either inside the RX radio connector shell from pin 4 to ground 
    (pin 6 or 17) or put them inside the control head from pin 4 to ground (pin 23) 
    and either way run the center point to the the controller digital input, and 
    program the controller to say "No power on link radio RX".</li>

<li>&nbsp;Pins 7, 8, 9, 10 are normally hooked to the control head freqency switch. If
    you use a single freq control head (without a switch) the virgin solder pads for 
    the switch can be used as tie points for the leads from the DB-15 cable. &nbsp; Or 
    you can take a multifreq head and remove the switch.</li>

<li>&nbsp;Pin 18 is normally hooked to pin 4 of the PL switch and you can free it up by 
    cutting the trace behind the switch and use the adjacent plated-through hole to 
    connect the DB15 cable pin.</li>

<li>&nbsp;Both DB15 pins 5 and 6 are hooked to audio coaxial cable (I used RG174 simply 
    becuse I had a spool of it on the shelf - it's lousy UHF coax but great as audio 
    cable) with the shields grounded to control head connector pin 2 on the head end 
    and to DB15 pins 8 and 9 on the other.</li>

<li>&nbsp;Pins 17 and 19 of the TX connector are the TX high current pins and should 
    connect to the Astron with heavier gague wire. &nbsp; For a low power radio 
    (T2xJJA, T3xJJA or T4xJJA model numbers) you want to use at least #12 wire, 
    and #10 for any higher power radio (the T5xJJA, T6xJJA, T7xJJA, T8xJJA series).
    Use the next larger size wire for any run over 10-12 feet. &nbsp; Pin 17 of 
    the RX connector is tied to pin 17 of the TX connector and to pin 17 of the 
    control head but that can be done with smaller gague wire to the RX-only 
    radio. &nbsp; Make sure that you jumper pin 6 of the TX and RX connectors 
    to pin 17 at each connector.</li>

<li>&nbsp;The size (amperage) of the "big fuse" depends on both the TX power level and the frequency band. &nbsp; See the Motorola manual for your radio for the proper fuse rating.</li>

<li>&nbsp;DB15 pin 11 and 12 (audio ground) can be connected to either pins 2 or 21 
    in the control head, or pin 2 on the control connector on either radio - whichever 
    is easier for you.</li>

<li>&nbsp;The above drawing does not show the internal mods to the radios (like 
    installing JU611 forcing the frequency 1 channel elements on).</li>

<li>Inside the TX radio connector:
  <ol compact type=A>
<li> The volume control is replaced with a jumper from the 
wiper pin (pin 15) to ground (pin 2) thereby setting a virtual 
volume control at zero.</li>
<li> The squelch control is replaced with a jumper from the 
squelch wiper (pin 14) to the hot side (pin 11) thereby setting 
a virtual squelch pot at maximum.</li>
<li> Connect an 47 ohm 1w or 2w resistor across the speaker leads (pins 
3 and 5) and <u>don't ground either of the speaker pins</u>!!! The Mitrek 
runs both speaker leads hot and you <u>will</u> let the magic smoke out 
of your radio if either speaker lead is grounded. &nbsp; If you are going 
to recycle an older cable or control head just assume that they ran a gounded 
speaker and trace both speaker leads from one end to the other and find 
those grounding jumpers and remove them.  Better yet, strip both control 
cable connectors of all wiring and start over.</li>
  </ol>
  <li> This jumper is required if you are using a factory Mitrek PL board 
and want to use the PL decoder in the receiver.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p align="left">Note that some control cables have a wire on pin 7 but 
do not have any on pins 6, 8, 9 and 10 (i.e. they are the "single 
frequency" cables) so chose the cables that you intend to chop up 
carefully. &nbsp; I first found this out the hard way, back when I 
had a 4-freq 6m Motrac, a 6-freq 2m Motrac, a 4-freq 440mhz Motrac 
and a 4-freq U43MSN Motran modified for 220mhz in my 1971 Ford Falcon 
station wagon... the 2m Motrac cable ended up with a length of 10-conductor 
stranded intercom cable taped to it... the conductors made up for 
the missing ones in the control cable plus provided for frequency 5 
and frequency 6 plus a couple of spares for TX PL tone selection.</p> 

<A NAME="Duplex_Mods">
<p align="left"><font size=+2><b>Duplex Mod For The Mitrek</b></font><br>
If you chose to use one radio and duplex it, you'll need to 
do these steps (<u><b>do not</b> duplex a 406-420mhz radio</u>, 
especially if it will be going to a hilltop!!! For the reason read 
the Cactus Radio writeup mentioned above):

<ol compact type="A">
<li>Jumper the F1 elements to run full time using JU611 as mentioned above.</li>

<li>Clip one side of CR403 (in front of L208). &nbsp; This prevents the 
receiver's audio amplifier (i.e. the speaker) from muting when PTT is keyed.</li>

<li>Clip one side of CR1 (near Q1004, in front of L702). &nbsp; This 
prevents the RX channel element from shutting down when PTT is keyed.</li>

<li>Give the RX and TX their own RF ports.
<ul type=1>
   <li>The mechanically simplest method I've seen is to disconnect the 
antenna relay coil wires from the motherboard and leave them floating, 
thereby using the front panel antenna port as the permanent receive 
antenna connection. &nbsp; If you want optimum performance you can 
replace the front antenna connection with a female-to-female type N 
bulkhead connector (which will require enlarging the hole in the front 
panel) and then using double-shielded cable to the RCA connector on the 
RX chassis (scavenge the old RCA plug for reuse unless you have some 
of the short-center-pin plugs in your junk box). &nbsp; I've also 
seen a female-N-to-female-SMA bulkhead connector mounted in the front 
of the radio with a male-SMA-to-male-RCA cable used to connect to the 
RX. &nbsp; Either way, you will want to use high grade double shielded 
coax on the RX port (I prefer RG-400). &nbsp; I've even seen a scrap of 
small diameter Superflex used here.</li>

   <li>Next, you have to give the TX it's own port. &nbsp; One way 
is to mount a double-female-BNC bulkhead connector in the sidewall 
of the radio. &nbsp; Then cut the transmit coax at the back side of 
the antenna relay and solder or crimp a BNC male to it, then plug 
it into the new connector.</li>

  <li>Probably the prettiest dual antenna jack mod I've seen is shown 
below this paragraph. &nbsp; Not visible is the back side of the plate 
that replaces the stock antenna connector. &nbsp; This plate mounts 
two female-to-female SMA bulkhead connectors, and the two new cables 
that run from the RF decks to the front panel have SMA male plugs to 
connect to that plate. &nbsp; This makes for the best shielding and 
minimum RF leakage. &nbsp; Unfortuntely this method requires enlarging 
the hole in the front panel to clear the two SMA connectors, and 
milling machines are not in the workshops of most hams.<br>
<img src="pix/mitrek-full-duplex.jpg" border=0></li>

<li>Motorola made some Mitrek-based high band mobile extenders by 
leaving the final transistor out of the PA deck, and below are 
four photos of how Moto modified the PA deck and how they did the 
TX antenna jack... they mounted a SO-239 into the low power heat 
sink (looking at the heat sink end of the radio it's on the right 
side). &nbsp; This mod would not be hard to duplicate, but again, 
milling machines are not in the workshops of most hams.<br>

<img src="pix/mitrek-mobile-extender-tx-pa-deck.jpg"><br>
Inside the PA deck. &nbsp; You can see the driver transistor under 
the red capacitor, and that the final transistor to the right of 
the driver has been replaced with a metal strap jumper.<br>

An addition to step "D-1" above that also adds a PTT indicator 
to the front of the Mitrek (for those folk that don't use a control 
head) is to cut the two coil wires at the antenna relay (instead 
of disconnecting them from the main board), and then hook them 
to a red LED and current-limiting resistor in series, and push 
the LED into a snug fitting hole drilled into the front panel 
of the radio. &nbsp; The top right corner of the serial number tag 
is a good place for the LED - there's just enough room inside the 
chassis for two or even three LEDs vertically along the right side of 
the handle... One could be  a green LED for a power indicator, a red 
one for PTT... (or a single two-color-three-lead LED for both). &nbsp; To
locate the LED holes just latch the handle up and in place (as if the lid 
was on and the radio was in it's tray) and drill the top hole in the 
pocket formed by the top right corner of the handle. &nbsp; Watch where 
the metal chips go, a good start is to drill the radio front panel with 
the radio upside down on the bench.</p>

<A NAME="Indicators">
<p align="left"><font size=+2><b>Status Indicators</b></font><br>
I used a single freq control head, and for status indication I mounted 
LEDs in the top of the head for COS and PL decode. &nbsp; I replaced 
the two incandescent bulbs in the head with red and green LEDs just 
for consistency. &nbsp; This gives me 3 LEDs in the top of the 
head: green for power, red for TX PTT, and a three-wire red/green 
for COS and PL decode. &nbsp; Someday I may add a blue LED for PL 
encoder disable (that feature was added to the radio after the control 
head work was complete). &nbsp; On an incoming signal without PL the 
dual LED glows green, and if PL is present it momentarily glows green 
showing the presence of the carrier, and when the PL decodes the red 
comes on with the green making amber to make it evident that both are 
present. &nbsp; There is no reason I used a 3-wire 2-color LED except 
that I had a few in the junk box. &nbsp; Two individual LEDs for COS 
and PL decode are just as easy. &nbsp; The PL decode signal from the 
one-jumper mod above (JU6 to JU1) is a logic level as opposed to an 
open collector, I added an open collector driver transistor in the 
head to drive the PL decode LED. &nbsp; I showed the open collector 
transistor in the PL decode section above as that's how the most 
recent radio was done.</p>

<p align="left">
The resistance rule of thumb for a 10ma led is 100 ohms per volt, 
so a 1.2k resistor in series with each LED is just about right for 
12-13v, but the value is not critical - a 1k or 1.5k will work just 
as well. &nbsp; For 20ma leds (the most common) use 50 ohms per volt, 
so 560 or 620 ohms is appropriate. &nbsp; For 2ma LEDs I use 4.7k or 
5.1K... &nbsp; Whatever value you pick, use that value on all the LEDs 
so the light intensity is the same - except on the blue LED. &nbsp; One 
characteristic of blue LEDs is that most of them take a little more 
current for the same intensity (they are not as efficient) so if you 
use blue you may have to use a little less resistance to get it to 
look right. &nbsp; This is one place where an old Heathkit resistance 
substitution box comes in handy.</p>

<A NAME="Mounting">
<p align="left"><font size=+2><b>Mounting</b></font><br>
To mount the radios in the system rack cabinet I bolted together a 
"sandwich" of two Mitrek mobile mounting trays and a thick steel rack 
shelf we found in surplus. &nbsp; On the top of the shelf is the TX 
radio, under the shelf is the RX radio upside down.  An Astron SS-25 
is mounted adjacent to the TX Mitrek, and a control head bracket is 
bolted below to complete the assembly. &nbsp; The sizing is perfect, 
you'd think that Astron designed the SS-25 specifically to fill the 
leftover space in the rack shelf. &nbsp; When lifting the assembly 
by the ends the shelf started to "bow" in the middle due to the weight, 
so I added two pieces of right-angle steel stock, one at the front and 
the other at the rear of the shelf, both running the full width of the 
shelf. &nbsp; The spacers in the drawing below are 1" long pieces of 
half-inch EMT conduit (only because I had a short length left over 
from a remodeling project) - lengths of a dowel with a hole drilled in 
the center or even stacks of washers would work just as well and are 
there only to allow the front of the lower radio to clear the front 
right-angle steel bracing when inserting it into or removing it from 
the mounting tray, and to allow access to reach the control head knobs 
and to see the LEDs.</p>

<p>The Astron is mounted to the shelf with long ty-wraps that extend 
through two holes drilled in the tray (at the "X" in the diagram below), 
across the bottom of the shelf, around and up the right side and back 
across the top of the supply. &nbsp; Yes, I could have opened the Astron 
and drilled a couple of holes in the bottom to mount it, but I 
didn't want to affect the warranty, and I wanted to be able to swap it 
out without having to pull the rack shelf out of the cabinet. &nbsp; The 
rack shelf I used is the exact height of the Astron, and the long ty-wraps 
(I used a couple of leftover riot handcuffs) work just fine. &nbsp; A speaker 
bracket is mounted to the bottom of the rack shelf behind the control 
head. &nbsp; The speaker lies flat against the bottom of the shelf with 
the speaker facing downwards.</p>

<A NAME="Second_RX">
<p align="left"><font size=+2><b>Second Receiver Concerns</b></font><br>
There may be times when you want to put a second Mitrek-based link into your 
system, or perhaps you already have an existing radio with a 10.7mhz IF in 
your rack. Well, Motorola has come to the rescue with the MSR-2000 
repeater. &nbsp; The Motorola MSR2000 and the Mitrek share a common 
history. &nbsp; In fact you could really stretch and say that the MSR is 
a base station version of a cross between the Mitrek and the Micor. &nbsp; While 
the Mitrek is a single-board "unified chassis" design, the MSR uses separate 
RX and TX boards, a control shelf, and other non-mobile features. &nbsp; Despite 
this there are many common components. &nbsp; One of these is the receiver 
IF crystal filters. &nbsp; The normal Mitrek and MSR-2000 IF frequency is 
10.7mhz. &nbsp; When there is a second receiver in the same cabinet the second 
receiver IF needs to be moved to a different frequency to avoid in-cabinet 
interference. &nbsp; If you put a second Mitrek based link in a system cabinet 
and have an interference problem you can move the IF of the second RX by 
re-ordering the channel element crystal for a 10.8mhz IF, installing the 
10.8mhz IF filters and realigning the RX. &nbsp; The part numbers for the 
10.8mhz filters are (thanks to WA6KLA for the information): Y201 is a 
48-84396K07 and Y202, Y203, Y204, Y205, Y206 are all 48-84396K06. &nbsp; If 
you do convert a mobile to a 10.8mhz IF <u>PLEASE leave a note inside the 
radio and on the front of the radio</u> - maybe use a big Sharpie pen on 
the sides of every IF can and write "10.8 IF". &nbsp; The next guy who 
gets to recrystal that radio will appreciate it!</p>

<A Name="Closing">
<p align="left"><font size=+2><b>Closing notes</b></font><br>
The dual Mitrek assembly described above is currently used as a single
channel full duplex UHF point-to-point link in our UHF repeater 
system. &nbsp; The main repeater is on controller channel 1 and the 
dual Mitrek is on channel 2. &nbsp; The reason for the use of dual radios 
is that the initial implementation used 450 Mitreks tuned to the regular
user input and output frequencies of the far-end repeater, later 
replaced by 420 Mitreks on real link frequencies. </p>

<p align="left">Setting the receiver frequency can be a bit tricky as 
the Mitrek uses a quadrature detector rather than a ratio detector or 
a crystal discriminator, therefore there is no "Motorola standard Metering 
Point #4" zero-center test point. &nbsp; The Mitrek designers added 
a circuit to help tune with a zero-center meter, but I've found that using 
a SinAdder gives me better results. &nbsp; If you don't have one, sometimes 
the simplest way is to use a frequency counter with the hot side of the test 
probe hooked to pin two of the channel element socket. &nbsp; Just remember 
to compensate for the 10.7mhz IF frequency. &nbsp; Then start looking for a 
Sinadder - maybe on eBay - they aren't that expensive and are a valuable 
addition to your test equipment collection. </p>

<p>Remember that the Mitrek mobile transmitter was not designed to be a 100% duty cycle transmitter. &nbsp; In fact, Motorola states in the manual that <u>the Mitrek is a 20-25% duty cycle radio</u>. &nbsp; Mobile radios are built small and inherently have undersized heat sinks, so to keep the heat rise down make sure you keep the output power at no more than half of the rated output (the lower the better, but they get dirty and squirrely if run too low). &nbsp; Obviously the lower the power on the same sized heat sink means the low power ones are preferred for repeat&nbsp;/&nbsp;link service - even a low power radio at half power is enough to drive an external amplifier to whatever power level you can afford. &nbsp; And pont-to-point links can use directional antennas... 15w into a 10db yagi gives the same performance as 150w into an omni with a lot less duplexer required...</p>

<p align="left">Consider doing the TX tuning with a eye on a spectrum 
analyzer - remember that a dummy load accepts all manner of frequencies 
without complaint, being non-resonant by design, while a tuned circuit 
(like an antenna or duplexer cavity) will complain about harmonic content 
and spurious output. &nbsp; To quote WB6VYX's comment on spectrum
analyzers "a picture tube is worth at least 20db of clean..." &nbsp; A 
transmitter that is not producing clean output will not behave on a hill 
and sooner or later WILL cost you your site and give amateur radio yet 
another black eye.</p>

<p align="left">Cooling of the RF power amp is critical if you want it to 
last. &nbsp; One trick is to remove the silver shield covering the PA and 
use a hole saw to cut the top cover of the radio so that a cooling fan can 
blow cool air directly onto the PA output transistors:

<p align="left">Use one hole to mount the fan and finger guard and another hole 
(with a second guard) for the air outlet. &nbsp; Finger guards in a variety of 
sizes are available at your local PC hardware shop. &nbsp; Cheap fans use 
brass or bronze bushings, good fans use ball bearings and are worth the extra 
money. &nbsp; Fans with needle bearings are even better but not too common.</p>

<p align="left">Design your rack mounting assembly with an eye to allowing air 
flow to and from the PA fans mentioned above and to keeping the rear heatsink 
cool... a rear fan and good air flow is mandatory. &nbsp; Personally I use 
two thermostat-controlled fans on the heat sink, one set 10 to 15 degrees higher 
than the other, and if the hotter one turns on it also turns on a digital input 
on the controller, which announces  "over temp on south link transmitter" and 
changes the pitch on the system MCW ID. &nbsp; If the users miss the voice 
announcement then the change in IDer pitch gets people's attention within the 
first 10 minutes of dialing up the channel.</p>

<p align="left">Onther method of fan control is to use a CMOS 555 timer 
chip trigerred by the PTT, and staying on for a time period after 
unkey. &nbsp; This idea can be extended by adding a thermistor on the 
heat sink and incorporating it into the 555's timing capacitor charging 
circuit so that as the heat sink gets hotter the timer takes longer to 
shut off the fan.</p>

<p align="left">An alternate way of controlling the PA deck fan is provided 
by some repeater controllers: a digital output can be programmed to turn 
on withthe first keyup and stay on for a programmed time period after
the last transmission. &nbsp; In fact, the Scom 7K programming manual 
gives this fan control function as one of their programming examples.</p>

<p>Or use <a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/tech-info/simple-repeater-fan-controller.pdf">a 
repeater fan control circuit</a> such as <a href="http://www.repeater-builder.com/tech-info/simple-repeater-fan-controller.pdf">this one</a>, designed by Robert Shepard KA9FLX.</p>

<p align="left">Be a good RF neighbor! &nbsp; After you install your 
radio in the system rack make sure you check the output with a spectrum 
analyzer - make sure that the transmitter is clean and by all means use 
a circulator followed by a good quality commercial pass cavity. &nbsp; The web 
page at <a href="http://www.ham-radio.com/n6ca/appnotes/repeaters/repeaters.html">N6CA's Repeater Application Note page</a> is <u>well worth reading</u>. &nbsp; RF 
neighborliness is one place where the UHF Micor mobile has it over the UHF 
Mitrek: every UHF Micor mobile has an internal 100w circulator, even the 
25watt models.... and I have seen some Micor UHF mobile circulators attached 
to some definitely non-Micor radios...</p>

<hr width=80% height=15 noshade noshadow color=black>

<p align="left">Good luck and after you get your Mitrek going please drop me 
an email and let me know how things went. &nbsp; I've spent a lot of time on 
this web page and it's twenty-five-plus revisions, and sometimes I'm wondering 
if anybody reads these missives to the masses...</p>
